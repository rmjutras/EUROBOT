Trying to fight against a day never ending
Watching the time but it's always the same
It never changes, time is endless take me
To fantasy land now

Where there is music and the beat's getting stronger
Day is all gone and the night is much longer
I can dream that you're with me and here
You're here to stay

'Cause there's nothing anyone can say
This is my dream and I can wish away anything
I don't want in my mind
And I'm free now

Get up and move it (you know that you can do it)
Get up and move it
And let the rhythm take you away to fantasy land
You know that ti can so

Get up and move it (you know that you can do it)
Get up and move it
And let the rhythm take you away to fantasy land
You know that it can

Look at me now - well there's a smile on my face and
You show me how to get to that magic place and
I feel young, I'm goin' strong I'm ready
For fantasy land now

Give me the beat and I can get through the day now
Show me the lights and then show me the way now
Dance the night 'till morning light you're with me
You're here to stay

It's a world of laughter 
A world of tears 
It's a world of hopes 
And a world of fears 
There's so much that we share 
That it's time we're aware 
It's a small world after all 

There is just one moon 
And one golden sun 
And a smile means 
Friendship to every one 
Though the mountains divide 
And the oceans are wide 
It's a small world after all 

It's a small world after 
It's a small world after all 
It's a small world after all 
It's a small, small world

Pushin' the sorrow really far and away
In the city of angels
Where the night is so tender
I can feel your hope and pride
Givin' the wings to every dreamin' inside
In the city of angels

Nothing's down for good, all is up to me
Heaven's up above, heaven's in my soul

Make me bold and make me stay
No fight, no bleeding neuron
I surrender to your way

And in my dream just you and I
We can fly up to the stars
Leavin' the world so way behind

I was born to be a legend 
Dreamin' of the seventh heaven
Pretty baby i was born to fly

Howlin' wind that blows into my hair
I just wanna reach my freedom 
Up into the air

Rider of the sky
Can you feel my heart is beatin' hard now baby
Rider of the sky
Flashin' like an arrow through, star bright

Rider of the sky
Heaven is alive between my fingers, baby
Rider of the sky
Dartin' like a dream comes true, star bright

In my mind i feel the rhythm
You can't stop this man from dreamin'
You can't stop my flight
Into the night

I don't wanna stand alone tonight
Heart of glass, I'm still too weak to fight

Music loud for me
To feel wild and free
Lettin' space and time just disappear

Power of sound
Power of your feelings
Bangin' the wall of destiny
I will smash it to the music
Power of sound 
Power, make me dizzy
Enter my mind and take me now
I will crash into the music
Power of sound

Lookin' for the meaning of my life
It's not easy to see things alright

Walkin' in the neon light
Heartbeat tickin' out the time
When I see your beady eyes
Flashin' in the glamo' night
Never stop rollin' babe!

Dancin' your head away

Until the night is on
You rock the world around
Set me set me free
And all is fallin' down
Never stop rollin' babe

When I gaze up to the highest
Heaven's silver stream - Mhh
Suddenly the moonlight's
Flashin' down all over me

Can you feel what I'm feelin
When I got you by my side
Stars in your eyes
Into my soul can make me shine

Moonchild
Fire and ice that burns
I can never reach
Can you let me touch
Your secret light inside
You're my moonchild
Handful of joy and pain
Every turn I'll find
Every step in time
I wanna be there with you

I would like to be the wind
the clouds to take away
You can tell the blue sky
Anyway is gonna stay

Let my spirit go
Let my body roll

Play the music
Can you reach to me
In a wheel of freedom

I wanna see you dance by my side
I wanna feel the drums in the night
Yeah babe - Can't wait till tomorrow
Fun is a touch and go

Play the music for me - for me, baby

In a wheel of power

Don't know why
Crazy heart I get no sleep in the night
Tumble down for you
Dreamin' lonely I feel broken in two

I keep
Waiting waiting waiting
And I live for the feeling
Feeling feeling

Take my breath away
Let me hear you say
When you kiss me thru the fire and rain
Take my breath away
Dreamin' wide awake
See I'm trusting all my life in your hands
Take my breath away
Let me hear you say

Rainy day
And the fire fills the TV blue sky
Your fingers on my face
Wake my body now before it's too late

I wanna drive in the heart of the night,
Down in the survival fight,
The city streets rollin' under so fast,
Rorain' in the stormy blast

Tokyo Lights,
Wind on my soul,
I won't regret hearin' your call,
Don't ask me why,
I feel the stars inside, they drive me wild - uooh

Just like an arrow thru' the night of fire
Tokyo Lights,
Flash in the sky,

I wanna feel like the spin of the wheel,
Never stop untill I die

Tokyo Lights...

I'm a believer now
Used to be sad and lonely
Waiting for someone else
To take away my pride

Live for you, live for me
Live together in one soul
If you let the light inside
I'll be your hero

I'm your TV hero
Beating together in the beatings of my heart
All we dream is forever - ever
Living together in your mind
I'm your TV hero
Fightin' together in the heatin' of the fight
And my name is forever - ever
A writing in gold among the stars
I'm your TV hero

Never get on my knees

Followin' my destiny

And I'm wishing you would come back through my door
Oooh why did you have to go?

I'm waiting for you
Alone in my silent room
I just wanna give my love to you...

I long for my time
Just tryin' to change your life
Come back and let me on your mind...

I don't care about the price you told me
My love is bigger than before...

You gotta tell me the reason
The reason you left me
To just forget my love...
Oh whoa, tell me the reason
The reason you broke my heart...

There's nowhere to go
I'm losing my self-control
I just need a place to hide my sorrow...

I like you babe
I've never seen a boy so sexy
Oh my God!
You make me crazy
You make me feel so good
Oh baby I'm on top

Hey boy you're so lonely tonight
Come on with me, feel the power
Hey babe everything is alright
So come on I can be your lover

Stranger, tonight I will be your light
Everywhere you want to go
Stranger, tonight everything's alright
And together we will fly

Don't say a word now
Tonight I wanna see you smiling
See you dance
Your body talk boy
I wanna be the one to give you one more chance

Everynight I need to fly away
Let the night so high
Don't you wanna stay?
Everytime you feel my heart so deep of love
(I need to know, I need to go, I need to love)
Let me be your rider of the storm

So try me tonight (and everytime)
I show you my life
Don't you forget me forever
I can't stop lovin' you
Every single day
Could you change my way?

It's a long time that I need you in my life
Like a starlight
You will shine for eternity
And please help me, now I'm losin' in my dream
Come together
You'll be mine for eternity... for eternity

Every breath you take, I love my day
Let me spend this night
It's a lovely game
Everytime you feel my heart so deep of love
(I need to know, I need to go, I need to love)
Let me be your rider of the storm

If I could only speak to you
Oh, like I did it before
Why did it all have to change?
I know nothing no more.

Living on hopes and dreams

I kept all my promises
I kept you deep in my heart
But now you want, you have won my feelings
My hopes and dreams left without a meaning
I am lost and blind, with no change of mind
What is there left to do?

If I knew that you were mine
I'd keep a lock on my heart
I'd keep you warm with my delight
I'd know we'd never part.

I kept all my promises
I kept you deep in my heart
But now you want, you have won my feelings
My hopes and dreams left without a meaning
I am lost and blind, with no change of mind
What is there left to do?

Hopes and dreams they died without your love
They left my heart on fire
Hopes and dreams were built upon secrets
Now I'm ready now for your love.

Hopes and dreams they're blowing with the wind
Like a turbo going stronger
Hopes and dreams were built upon secrets
Now I'm waiting now for your love.

All right my baby
I like you to make it
I like you to make a U-turn
All right my lover
I'm right under cover
I had self confidence to learn

Well!.. I'm ready to grow
Feeling that your love is real
Well!.. I'm ready for sure
Quitting all my crying for fear

If you ever leave me I won't die
If you ever need to be without my love
Wanna make a promise I won't cry...
Even if you are all I've got

You make me believe it, I'm having a regret
For letting you feel the wild one
The war is over, I'm bowed and defeated
I won't be asking for some more

Bugatti, I saw you in a dream
Volvo, you're running hot like steam
Subaru, you start off like an arrow
Volkswagen, you never give me sorrow.

Sitting at the wheel
My tires burn to squeal
I know that I will soon be
A hero in the grand prix.

Saturday night, I win at Le Mans
Risking my life, I wave to my fans
Morning collides, champagne on ice
Now I'm a star, driving my car.

Ferrari, the fastest on the street
Rover, you are my everything
Bentley, a coffin for a king
Mercedes, so classic and so chic.

I drive without emotion
I calculate each curve
I know that I will soon
A hero in the grand prix.

It's easy, to laugh at my desire
(To laugh at my desire)
Too easy, to catch my heart on fire
Fire, fire, fire.

When you're looking so divine
My heart's in motion
When you slip your hand in mine
I'm in commotion.

Just how I lost my head for you again
I'm not sure I could tell you
But now you've got me down your road again
I've lost all track of time.

It's easy, to laugh at my desire
(To laugh at my desire)
Too easy, to catch my heart on fire
Fire, fire, fire.

When you're near I'm on my knees
In blind devotion
When you're gone I don't know where
I've got this notion.

And now I'm feeling like a fool again
I'm drowning in desire
I know you're laughing at the state I'm in
You know it drives me wild.

It's easy, to laugh at my desire

Hide and seek it's your destiny
C'mon and play this game with me
A fantasy, count from one to three

Break a wall with this heavy maul
I don't know why; it's terrible
Insanity, it's not good for me

Here in your arms I feel fine
Why won't you tell me?

Hey! This is the labyrinth of love
It's a maze full of empty walls
Give me your life
So I can fly...
These are bricks, only in the labyrinth of love
I'm in your heart forever
Now we'll find a place to go
Where we can hide and abide

You can start
To play the game with us
We are pretty friends for happiness
A funny emotion livin' inside your heart
You take the power now

It's a neverending time to be so fine
All together
I can fly through the sky, I feel fine

'Cos we are Little Twin Stars
A shining light dance into the night
The way is bright today, you run away

'Cos we are Little Twin Stars
Sweet company livin' by your side
Like heroes we can give you the fantasy

We are livin' in a magic dream
It's a better place than reality
C'mon now, this is your happy time
And everything is all right

I work from nine to five
I see my time is passin' and
I don't kno where is the bottom to stop

Take me to that lands
Where I can find all the words
Take me the top
Where I can my game

Set me free now !!!

MAGIC MAGIC
MAGIC As a symbol
MAGIC MAGIC
Just to say I'm feeling that
MAGIC MAGIC
MAGIC In the day time
MAGIC MAGIC
Just to keep the faith alive

I spend my days away
I feel my life fading and
I don't know the way to switch off the word

Bad power I can feel it now
Back magic just to take time

Bad power I can feel it now
Back magic just to take my time

In my mind there's a signal
But I can not feel
Just as it getting in my soul
it's like a greed disease
I know something's in grave
When they hit up the nights

Bad power I can feel it now
Before I knew it was too late
You were stealing the life

I just to the stars
Come to me
Only an illusion can start
My heart can be
Take my time, dance with me
I can take out my heart
'Cause my love is deep

In the sky there's a blackhall
That I can not see
In my heart there's a deep hole
Like a greed disease
I know something's in grave
When they hit up the night

Nineteen-eighty four
Big Brother

I feel so shy, I've never been here
The windows are boken and it's buning with cold
Darling I'm afraid the night is so long
The face of the man is

Losing my breath, I'm losing my soul
Big Brother's face is on behind every door
There's nothing to do, there's nowhere to hide
The shadows are black

Nineteen-eighty four too tired
Nineteen-eighty four to run, run
Nineteen-eighty four I'm waiting
Nineteen-eighty four understand me

Big Brother,
Tell me what to catch
Why me, I just don't understand
Big Brother,
Just our tender love can't teach me how to go on

So many in many wats
I tried to believe in big brother's day
I've lost all my hopes to switch off that screen
I don't see the future as the world that will be

Nineteen-eighty four too tired
Nineteen-eighty four to run, run
Nineteen-eighty four I'm waiting
Nineteen-eighty four understand me

Big Brother,
Tell me what to catch
Why me, I just don't understand
Big Brother,
Life can't help me to go on

Big Brother
Big Brother
Just our tender love can't teach me how to go on

Big Brother 
Just our tender love can't teach me how to go on

Can't you see time is looking in my eyes
Can't you feel me now,Love is gone
Far away my sleeping eye
What you want from me
But, baby, tonight in the very moment
Silence is all you´ll find
But now is the time and I'm really going
Two faces in night so cool

See
What you want my body, feel it
And i need your touch now
Black out, desire for you is still growing and I
Miss your body now

I wan't need you tonight
You're feeling good, far away from me
What a fool to believe you once again
Can this heart try love

Oh, baby tonight how we
Crazy lovers
Can never go on too long
But time after time how it,
Keep on to believe in the light to go

There's no sign of the lights of desirous
There's no sign of the life if I like it
My light concedes by remember direction
He turned away to discover connection

I must be careful
I know the fire on the moon
I must be careful
He could be on the otehr side

There's some shadow that wants to approach me
What can I do
I just try to come to me
I know that they seem to play around about me
In another way, for the silence around me

I must be careful
I know the fire on the moon
I'm just nin the sky, now
They look you and then another
Come and remind me that
They know there's fire on the moon
Come and remind me that
Cuz I can break
Time at that time
I try to write on the wall
the name of my real people
TIme in these nights
I count the names it means protection
On your direction
Lead your affection

As far as I came to see what that light is
In another time they had a cue to see around it
Now there's nothing to lead by survival
Too late to say that came from the fire

Time at the time
TIme in these nights
Time at the time
I try to write on the wall the names of the real people
Time in these nights...

I would like to leave my lonely room
Where I had a lot of happy lovely times with you
Just believe me that passion stopped
Oh doc I'm tryin' to realize oh! oh! oh!

Little babe you were made to love
In that crazy night your fashion strike into my soul
Like two lovers
"Don't leave me alone"
I said to you in that night time oh! oh! oh!

Doctor doctor save me! You know what I meant
You can help me! It's right! Myself!
Doctor doctor, she was a witch of the night
Of the night

She was an island, like an island
Just an island to love, with a magical sea
Was my island, love island
She was out of my time
She was out of my life

Everybody needs a girl so hot like that
But my love for her was not so good, was only bad
Just believe me, it was my destiny
To make a love to her oh! oh! oh!

Now I'm running from the city light, an illusion
And confusion's deep inside my mind
But I never wanna see you again
Because I am your prisoner oh! oh! oh!

Doctor doctor, she was a witch of the
Night of the night

Fly, fly, fly

To my life from my dreams to my skin forever

Generation of love

We need to say I love you
Before the life is gone

Listen babe listen every moment
And you can hear my voice
I wanna be with you
To show you my love tonight
I want your love my girl

I'm feeling your pleasure,
I'm feeling your pain,
A thorn in my side,
I try to protect...

You say that you love,
That you always will,
But now love is danger,
How does it feel...

I can't live without you,
And without your sex,
Don't dream it's over,
Touch me again...

I don't want to fall,
I don't want to die,
And I love your body,
I love your style...

Doctor save me now,
On the way to me,
What do you think about,
About my strange love,
Just I'm falling down,
What I'm gonna do,
Why I'm feeling so wrong...

I'm in danger, my heart is broken...
I'm in danger, my time is stolen...

I've read all the papers,
Disease everywhere,
In Japan in Europe,
In Newzealand...
The people are leaving,
With dangerous race,
But now you can see,
My suffering face...

Don't ever let me down
Because I'm feeling so hot
I know we cried, for once I won't
Tomorrow I leave this town
The bizarre when I'm feeling right
We are both trying to forget what we're here for
Yeah I will survive again
Might, yeah only survive for you

Take my life for a sacrifice
Oh my heart's a flame
I say take my time
My time was offered again as a sacrifice for you
Never we meant seeking the truth
Talking about me too
Into my dreams we walked down to see
The world is ours and now
There's fire burning inside my mind
That desire dancing upon my chest
Oh yeah I will survive again, might yeah
Only survive for you
Take my life
Take my time

Oh yeah I will survive again, might yeah
Only survive for you

(I) don't like to be
your friend
'Cause

I can do much better
Can give you many more things
To prove you
I'm your man, why should I give in and be a loser
Can't you see all I want
Is your love
So I'm gonna change and make
Another start

I'd like to be your hero
Tell me my feeling's right
And I guess you won't mind
Sometimes hero
Spending the rest of my life
Like you hero not only your lover

(I) don't want to be a toy
You're using to play with
A toy you drop or break
To prove youself you're strong

Why should put up with my big lot
Can't you see that all I want
Is I'm gonna chance and make
Another start

I dream on dancing with you...
My desire for something new, baby!!!
Let every-one come into;
And relax, let the music move... baby!!!

Come with a lotta friends, from the universe!!!

Lets all DANCE ON THE UNIVERSE!!!
Lets have fun, and forget your work...
Lets all DANCE ON THE UNIVERSE!!!
Move your body and be the first...

I see my friends dancing too...
They're all happy, and they feel good... baby!!!
It's only one thing to do;
And relax, let the music move... baby!!!

Why you always say that I'm your love
If you don't bring my soul
I'm so sad to know that I waste all my time
Without your paradise

Come on baby let me know your lovely soul take it whole
Baby tell me if you could
Love me tonight over the time

Another day another night
Another time to cry to smile
To keep your lovely sight

Another day another night

Loose into your eyes

Everytime is like a dream with you

But a day has come
And she went away
And my life was only empty rainy days
Without loving you
All my time is blue
And there is no blood into my heart and veins

Walking down the street
It will be better
I would like to meet
You and no other
Just a while with you
For not to be in blue
Cause I'm alone

Takin' me away

Showing me the way
Now and forever
Take a while with you
For never feelin' blue

But tonite gonna be all right
And your love gonna hold me tight
Bad people gossips can't take me away

Down in the dark love is blue water
Heart's a pearl and I'm a sirene

In this world I'll find the way to live in
Sinking down 
Inside our moby dick 

A little submarine for you and me
A little shelter that no one else can see

Down in the ocean where no one else can be 

Take a dive my love is in the deep
Of this blue water

Holding me tight 
Love will keep us warm

It was just a lonely night
I was turning out the lights
And no things to remember
Everything comes into view
He was talkin' all his time I was losin' my mind

I know we were making good love good love
Satisfaction deep and down inside
Like a hand into sweet velvet glove

Touch me too much baby you got a touch
Kiss me kiss me drive me inside
Touch me too much for my brain is too much

Touch me too much baby we keep in touch

Angel face and devil smile
Make it fast and make it hard boy you make it

Because the night I wanna sleep by my side
And if you'll want me I will fall in love forever
I wanna be the only woman you need
A night extasy I would like to see together

All my dreams are to fall in love without
The cares I don't wanna be free and show you baby
All my love and to be forever with you

And make a good love together
Sexy shock

But nothing will can compare it
Sexy shock

Down on my knees I can't explain what I feel
So deepin' in me in this sensual situation
All that I need a body language to me
Whenever I'll be little girl for all your pleasures

If I set the world on fire
Would you try to understand
That my life is empty now
Now that you're not anywhere?
Got me thinking back of those days
Being one for every night
Feeling passion love and care
All the we had was what we shared

You say you're free now
From boundaries and love demanding
But I still believe it's true
A love like this
Could climb a mountain

You're my life, the spark I live for
Stuck to love you so
You're my life, my reason why
'Cuz my love was too blind

If I conjured tricks and magic
You'd be a vision unaware
You're my phantom of the past
There's no doubt my love will last

I don't wanna let the system get me down, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Let me take you on a run all around ooh yeah, ooh yeah

We can make it go right, let's dance
We can make it all night, to dance
We can make a party all time

So I can lose all my control
I want to free my body n' soul forever

Forever young generation, I'd sure like to be
Together find a combination, let the music be

We can have a good time all day
We can have enjoyment again
Do you wanna feel me tonight?

So I can lose all my control
I want to free my body n' soul forever

Uh-huh, young generation

People say that we are much too wild in town, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
There is not much you that's gonna argue down ooh yeah, ooh yeah

We can have a love thing to tell
Leaded by your touring my back

I got this feel in my heart can tell me
The funny meaning I have inside
I can't believe it hurts my darling
So blind to try and fall again

Got to be yourself had a lot to say

When everyday and everynight
It's a shame you know that it's time to

style

So I can get it together and be

And give me some time to make up

Time by myself forgive me baby

But simply the way you love me
Tells me that my life will go your way

God, I've been waiting all night for your call
'Cause you thought that I was gonna be at home
I'd like to hear your sweet voice on the line
I never knew that love could be so strong

If you wanna take me higher
We can fly up to the stars

If you let the light inside
Only you can have me tonite
Every kind of magic delight
I can see all the paradise

If you want my love
Come on and feel my body
Baby, I can't live without you
I lose my control

Save me
Only you can survive, you hold me tight
I feel crazy
Let me kiss you everyday, every night

Traffic in my bed
With all the men I feel so sad
Without you I'm so lonely, babe
You don't make me cry tonight

Traffic in my bed
With all the men I feel my heart is dead
Only you can light my fire
I want you tonight, desire!

When I fall in love
I wanna be you lady
Baby, I can't stay without you
I don't lose control

Hey, hey, hey
Streaming down your tears
Baby stop that crying
Give up to me

Go, go, go
Baby wipe your cheeks
Breaking down the trunk
Cause i need your beat

Guiding you to your heart
I love for treating myself
To you, tonight I need it
In my heart, find a soul
You came to me like a blow
For crying, so fall in love again

You catch my broken heart
It's never too late
I'm flying baby
Yearning only for your love
You catch my broken heart
There's nothing to fain
You read me baby
Baby now and all the night

I'm gonna see you
Just around the corner
Along the way I meet your love, hot fire

You got your freedom
Day by day and over
But in the middle of the night I wonder

Song by song
Tell me what is wrong
Never you kill me, what you do baby
Sing a song
Do it all along
I play a new harmony
Ready to let me feel

Kiss me kiss me, baby won't you kiss me
You hurry up and all the night you squeeze me
Kiss me kiss me, baby won't you kiss me
You wanna give, I wanna get your love

I'm gonna have you
Till the time is over
Among the people I can't feel desire

I'll never leave you
When the night is over
Up in the sky you make me feel the power

Tender infatuation
Joyful, my conversation
Even you talk
Of sending over the skin

Harking at me, you learning
What kind of treasure I am
Only for you
I treat myself to you again

Above my destiny
You're the freedom
And a whisper got to jerk
My reality
A confusion ever felt!
Oh baby, I'm your

NATURAL GIRL
You know like mummy has made me
Carve your name and write my destiny
NATURAL GIRL
What is the colour of love
Oh...colour of my cheer

Honey, I need your backing
Gimme a power lesson
Learning delay
Oh baby, try me out again

Kindly, I feel sensation
Spinning around the treasure
Even you watch me
Babe, I'm livin' ashamed

Only when you're feeling alone
You dial my number
Super Venus close in your home
I will be your thunder

Body guard love is hard
Falling in your eyes
Love is true
All is blue
In the tenderness of the sunshine light

Body guard I'm your angel in the night
Body guard with your passion lost inside
Body guard crazy warrior for your love
Body guard you are so deep inside my soul
I'm so hot without control

If you need protection by me
I'll be there forever
Angel of your body you see
Forever together

Kiss me forever
Whenever
'Cause I need you
We'll stay together
Forever
Love and passion

Like a disco fever
Wanna make me feel the power
Because night and day I need the music
Everybody dance on the fire

Stop that music, stop the fire
In my heart I feel desire
Stop that music, catch the power
Ever and ever
Baby, forever

Hold me forever
And ever
'Cause I feel you
Waiting together
Like never
For my passion

All alone upon the shore,
We sit together in the calm of the summer breeze.
I move in a little closer
And I slip my arm in yours.

The sun shines bright upon the ocean waters,
There until the glow of the evening
Sweep me up like the waves and hold me tight in your arms,
Tell me that you love me too.

Knowing that you care
Makes me feel alive

Underneath the summer sky
We sit in silence in the warmth of the midday sun.
With my head upon your shoulder
I melt into your embrace.

The birds fly high above the ocean waters,
There until the hush of the evening
Take me up like the tide, I'll always stay by your side,
Love me the way I love you.

Knowing that you care
Makes me feel alive

Our love is deeper than the ocean waters,
Kiss me till the turn of the evening,
Like the sand needs the sea, your heart belongs here with me.
Love me like I love you.

Knowing you love me
I feel so alive

Nel blu, dipinto di blu
Felice di stare lass
E volavo, volavo felice pi in alto del sole ed ancora pi su
Mentre il mondo pian piano spariva lontano laggi
Una musica dolce suonava soltanto per me

Volare, oh, oh!
Cantare, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Nel blu, dipinto di blu
Felice di stare lass
Nel biu, dipinto di blu
Felice di stare lass

Come back to me, I need an emotion

We walk alone in the jungle nights
I guess it's just the way we want to love
We feel the music and dance so free
And this all a part of destiny

Jumping on a bus all around what a craazy scene
Running all the time, yes I want you tonight, oh babe

And let's make it like it should together
Baby take the time we have
And let's make it good (make it good)

Because there's just one possibility
There's no turning back if you don't trust me now
You know what you mean to me
So believe it - baby I want you

Maybe we can work it out together
We've got loving
We can make it stronger
Maybe we can be as one forever
We've got only time and
We can make it longer

I just can't get enough it's so good
When I'm right here beside you
I know that you need
This lovin' just like I do (like I do)

Lifted me up and then you threw me down
Played with my heart and turned it inside out
You made me believe that I could have it all
You went and left me but you never called

I need respect because I still believe
I'm missing you just like you missing me
And there is a place for me inside your heart
I'm still a part

Why can't you see
There's something coming from me
I'm something special baby come and see
You gotta see
Your life is ever sunny, follow me
Don't go without me

(Why can't you see you're the one for me
Got to believe you're the one for me)

Treated me bad but that's all in the past
Baby just love me we can make it last
Pick up the phone and say you'll be around
Maybe tonight we're gonna rock on down

I can forgive you 'cause I can't forget
The way that you loved me on the day we met
Knowing you need me just like I need you
Say that you do

Every night I think of you baby
My heart just starts beating so crazy
Every kind of words you give me
Must be giving me pain so badly

Well I know I'm not the kind to be with you
No chance to be the light of your eyes
Please don't treat me so tenderly
'Cause I don't wanna get hurt

Anymore anymore
I'm not your slave of love
Don't touch me, please leave me alone
So I can say goodbye to my sorrow

Anymore anymore
I'm not your slave of love
That's enough, get out of my sight
So I can live another life baby

Every night I think of you baby
The darkness growing inside me's crazy
Every kind of words you give me
Just ring hollow, set me free Oh God !

You can spend your money baby
Trying to buy me cheap
That's no way to do it honey
Let my love come free

To be my baby
Takes more than meets the eye
Baby you know, just for tonight
You've got to learn to give and take

So be my love tonight
Speed me to the brightest light
So be my love tonight
Make me feel tomorrow never comes

Hold me to your body baby
Never let me free
Can't you feel the sweet sensation
Over you and me

When I'm with you my time is like a paradise
And I don't care, just only you!

Into the sky your sun is keeping rise and shine
And without I'm feeling blue

Do you make me crazy
There's a fire inside of me
Baby only you can set me free
This is what I feel
Come on and touch my body now
And close to you
Where I long to be

Into my dream
For eternity
This never ending love to live into my dream
Just you and me
Like a fantasy
Don't stop this never ending love
Into my dream

And close to you my mind will never fall in down
'Cause you will ever break my heart

And close to you life is a flower all around
This love is shining like a star

You control all my emotions
You control all my sensations
I'm a slave in your devotion
You're the master don't say no

I can give you everything the best I can
I can learn to walk upon a dirty wire
Make me live you make it and really drive me mad
For your sex I die 'cause I'm just a man

My woman is dangerous
She burns up my desire maybe she's a liar
My woman is dangerous pretty devil
My woman is dangerous
She takes my feelings higher and she lights my fire
My woman is dangerous pretty devil and angel for me

You say you're my destination
Son of a bad generation
You say I have no education
I'm a servant don't say no

You, you're my lucky star
I want forever to fly next to your light
Me, I'm longing to see
How far we'll go in the land of never-never

Just feel me inside where hearts beat love in time
Let's find out together darling every day, every night

What is love

Glittering star dust in our hearts
What is love

I, I'm wondering why
No word is pleasant enough to call you mine
You, you're asking me now
Will we forever be bound come rain, come shine

Run through the night
The only way for you to stay alive
No place to hide
That is the price you pay to lead your life

Someone is waiting for a wind of change
Hi hi samurai fight fight for your rights
Somebody's knocking better take a chance
There is a danger coming back to you

Fight for your rights
You are the winner on the sky
Time after time you'll realize

Someone is waiting for the children of the night
You got the fever inside

I feel the fire burning in my soul
You look at you

Mess around with brothers

Why why why how do they can't hear 
It's my shout shout shout their side pointed to

We've spent our time searching for love
Searching for love

Time was on my side

Will we ever be true, ever be true, ever be true

Hiding you leave someone
Who's given so much to you
How can you leave this man who's only crying out
Being true

Now is the only one waiting was me, waiting was me

Talk about the right and wrong
An illogical dream to deny

Victim of a doctor plan
He was born because of vanity

Ough ough doctor ough ough

But a small butterfly
Can relight the poor mind
Now and for all the eternity

City, town and country
Worried for a wizard

Looking for ways to find a brand new place
Where to keep away bad thoughts

You get me over the skin
I feel you kiss in my dream
And then you "ahi-ahi-ahi"
Wake me up in the night

You're running over the time

To inflame my beat
This day belongs only to you

One love (only love), one love (just for love)
We don't need another explanation

To save the things that you are giving me

Because one love (only love), one love (just for love)
Is my way to live on fascination
I hope (only love), I hope (just for love)
To feel the magic you are sending to me

It's been so hard to stay without you
When the night seems to never end
I'm lost in the jungle of desires
I just want to relive you again

Play with my heart everyday
It's time for holiday
Come into my life

Step one and two, celebrate
And tell me now the way
To walk the starlight

Boom shalaka laka boom
Shalaka laka love
I need your body next to mine

Now keep the smile on your face
And take my breath away
Don't say me good night

Give me your hand in the air
We'll fly around the space
Don't look back, my heart

Baby I don't understand
Why we can't just all go and reach out our hands
This time will be the last I feel
Last time, make it all so clear
I need to so

So take this broken wings
And learn to fly again
Learn to fly so free
And when we hear the voices sing
The broken love will be alive and let us sing

Baby, I've prayed tonight
We can pay what was wrong
And make it right
Baby until I know
That you're half of the first
And of what makes me whole
I need you so

Get me crazy tonite, to set my feelings all right
Cause I don't wanna miss last train to survive
Get me ready to ride, let's go my babe to fight
'Cause I can't stop me now, Let's go crazy

I just don't care, if it's illegal
I need to break my boring life down
Ready to spare, shooting for freedom
Be by my side, to be by my side
And get it...

Crazy night, crazy people want to run away
Getting fun together
Crazy night, crazy circus to stay, on my way
For a while, forever

Feel the city's alive, a gipsy living tonite
A dirty dancing above the Central Park
Feel the beast is in you, 'cause I know it's in me too
Let become real
The widest dream you've got

He lives in you
He lives in me
He watches over
Everything we see
Into the water
Into the truth
In your reflection
He lives in you

Wait, there's no mountain too great
Hear the words and have faith
Have faith

He lives in you
He lives in me
He watches over
Everything we see
Into the water
Into the truth
In your reflection
He lives in you

He lives in you
He lives in me
He watches over
Everything we see
Into the water
Into the truth
In your reflection
He lives in you

Many days and nites I think we're living in a world of fantasy
Such a pleasant moment and a feeling
Again I feel in the air

When you're on your way
for you cannot stay
and you feel alone and
It's hard to say
When your heart is down
Laying on the ground
THat's the only way out

DREAMS this is where I am gonna be
just half a step from illusions
DREAMS never will I know what I see
no one will tell me the reason why
I'll be lost in dreams

That's the place where people find the loving
find the time to getaway
Men and women losing their religion
lose the grip of their lives

When you're on your way...

DREAMS...
...............
DREAMS...
...............
I just wanna try to disappear
don't wanna take no decisions
DREAMS...
...............

Look the sky (it) seems so starry tonite
It seems so deep and magical oh oh oh
It could be just like an ebony night
It could be just the last time

Stay this night and fly
Stay tonite, be mine
Lay down your body on the grass

Love me baby
Don't go away
Listen to your heart
Listen to your heartbeat
Feel me babe
Feel it tonite
Listen to your heart
Listen to your heartbeat

Don't believe'em there's nobody else
It could be lovely and physical oh oh oh
(You) know that I'm like a medicine man
Let me take care of you now

Another night to say:
Things are about to change, is it forever?
Another game to play
When we hare a world together

Open your eyes and believe me
You gotta live and dream again
Still catching the sun as you're gliding
Uohoh!

Ev'ry night you take my heart
Into the stars and ev'rywhere
I dream to see you back
When I return but you're not there
Ev'ry night I feel you smile
And I can't stop be similing too
So tell me how, today
I'll find the way to be with you, every night

Pictures in black and white
Bridging you from the past into the future
I want you now to try
To be always "you" forever

I'm your lover
Don't you understand
We've got to talk it over
Don't you know this time will be for good

It is now or never
I will show the world I mean it all the way

That I believe in lovin' you
And I believe your love is true
And even if I cry for you
Nothing can be done

'Cos I believe in lovin' you
And I believe in my heart is true
And even if I die for you
My mind will never change
'Cos I believe in love

You're my baby
Everywhere you are
Don't have to think it over
Here's another chance that can't be lost

She came for me,
And left my heart with a desperate fight,
Love me all the time,
For she's a lady giving what you can't believe...

Babe, it means so right,
I believe myself and forget all the lies,
Just believe on my side,
She's the best you can see,
She's the one right for me...

Night girl - wanna hold you,
You can be my lover baby,
Night girl - want to feel you,
Every night you take my heart
And drive it higher...

She gives me all that I've been waiting for,
Just to know how she drives me mind,
And she's the one who breaks my heart,
And gets my S.O.S....

Night girl - for a moment,
Want to be my lover baby,
Night girl - you drive me crazy,
Just together we can get into the fire...

Black days lost in the rain
Now I can see the sun
Feeling right yes I'm feeling right
Cause I understand I learned my lesson

I will be dancing my heart away
When I see the fire in the sky
Baby I'll tell ya

Save your voice to sing a song
Save your time to live your life
C'mon c'mon you sing this song now
Be the light you feel inside
Save your voice to sing a song right
Save your time to live your love
C'mon c'mon you dance this song now
Be the sound you feel inside your voice

Black nights wastin' your time
Now you can take the lead
Feeling good yes you're feeling good
If you save your voice to sing a song now

I don’t need another bad illusion
I don’t need you to believe another time
Is it dangerous tonight?
Is it so dangerous?

Times goes by
It’s easy tonight, it’s easy tonight
Just dance your tears away

Take care of my heart if you love me too
Come on out and say
Take care of your heart ‘cos I need you so
Be the sunshine in my best times
Make me dream again

Take care of my heart if you love me too
And you will find a way
Take care of your heart ‘cos I need you so
Don’t you worry don’t be sorry
I’ll be back again
Take care of my heart…

I don’t need to see your heart on fire
I just wanna see the colors of your soul
Is it possible tonight?
Is it so dangerous?

Ain’t easy to leave you
I don’t need anything but you
I’ll never desert you
And I’ll be back again

Someday
When we are wiser
When the world's older
When we have learned
I pray
Someday we may yet live
To live and let live

Someday
Life will be fairer
Need will be rarer
And greed will not pay
God speed
This bright millennium
On its way
Let it come
Someday 

Someday
Our fight will be won then
We'll stand in the sun then
That bright afternoon
'Till then
On days when the sun is gone
We'll hang on
If we wish upon the moon 

There are some days dark and bitter
Seems we haven't got a prayer
But a prayer for something better
Is the one thing we all share 

Someday
When we are wiser
When the whole world is older
When we have learned
I pray
Someday we may yet live
To live and let live
One day, someday
Someday
Life will be fairer
Need will be rarer
Greed will not pay
God speed
This bright millennium
Let it come
If we wish upon the moon
One day
Someday
Soon 

One day
Someday
Soon

Break out and go your own way
Ev'ry time you need to wander
Get down and throw your heart away
To follow the skyline

Hold me now was easy to tell you
It's my life you don't let me down
But I can see tonight
Everything was right don't you understand

It was
Time to say goodbye
Time for us to realize
Nothing changes after you
Ev'ry thing can do but it was
Time to say goodbye
Just to fly up in the sky
You & I can still be friends
Holding each others
Hands in this goodbye

Ain't free to ride your own way
It has to got a price to pay, so
Believe I gotta say to you this time I
I found that

Cheeky gal with a sweet cherry heart
Baby I go crazy - crazy for you
Fancy now, take it easy tonight
Baby are you ready?

You'll be my toy
I'll be your toy
It's a game we're playin' together
Look at me - turn around
Make a move - to the sound
And enjoy the game of lovin', lovin' tonight

Hanky panky na na na na
Baby are you ready, are you ready for me
Gimme your emotion
Gimme your sensation
Fancy goin' crazy baby in your fantasy
Gimme your emotion
Gimme your sensation
Hanky panky play the game of you and of me

Love is now, baby, love is the key
Dancin' shakin' movin' - movin' for you
Don't be shy, and I'll be your desire
Baby, are you ready?

Walking alone in the nite
We're a man and a woman
Just taking our time to believe
We're just children in love
So many words you've been trying
To confess your confusion
Got no more chances to doubt
That I'm ready to go

Hold me now : There's no world without you
Won't you tell me why I'm looking my mind!
Yesterday was another story
But I'm giving myself today oh baby

Gimmie gimmie just a sign we're
Still alive girl
Is it a waste of time for your love?
Gimmie gimmie just a reason
To believe, babe, or turn around and watch
I'm walking away

Not I'm pretending we're made
To be living together
We're taking our time to be sure
We're just adults in love
Deep in my heart there's the will
To be loving each other
But down to my eyes I'm afraid
I am willing to go

Hold me now...

You really got me right
I'll crave for some action tonight
Got money to be spent
I am gonna stay out until late

Gimme gimme gimme the right attitude
If you wanna be my queen tonight
Let me let let me only you dude
Gotta hear some rocking music
Shaking up your booty

Heard beat
Listen to the rhythm
The boom boom that I feel inside

Stop onto my hard beat
Dancing on the rhythm
This boom boom is forever
Bang bang now or never

I'm really cool tonight
I'll look for action allright
Ain't gonna stay at home
At the disco's the law and my dome

Baby in the moonlight I dream of you
I am loving you, you're in my heart
Another light is shining in my soul
You brighten up my night
Once again

My life's gonna be all right
Just tonight I wanna fly
With you in my soul
Don't break my heart

I'll fly for you forever with my heart
Tonight, my life, forever
Tonight we'll stay together in the light
Uoh together!
I'll fly for you forever in the night
Uoh, my love, forever!
I'll fly with you my honey take my life,
Gonna fly with you again

When I wake up in the night
Struck-by-light
I'm feeling dizzy from my dreams however
When I see the starry sky
Emotions with wings will get me high, so high...

Baby in the sunlight I think of you
I am dreaming of your warm embrace
The sun is lighting up my soul, oh yeah!
You brighten up my day once again

Did you know your love, my baby
Wasn't hard to find
Did you know that nothing ever
Could have kept you away from me

Now I can tell you babe
Nothing has changed today
Opening inside my heart
So don't you cry for me
Everything is alright it's alright

One day in another time and place
We'll be leaving back today
And we'll be together baby
Easy to say

One day when the sun blows out of the rain
And the shadows only fade then forever
You'll find me, find me the way one day

Can't you see that my love my baby
Is gonna stay with you
Can't you see that all we need is
Walking across the bridge

Frustration, sensation
Are you never gonna show emotion
Don’t tell me you’re lying
‘cause you make me wanna feel like dying

You, tell me baby that your love is true
Tell me that you need me like I do
‘cause you make me feel
As a girl brand new

Destiny, it’s in my eyes to see
I give up I give in
To the gloom that I’m in
And your loving words
Just don’t sound real

Destiny, it’s in my fantasy
I get up I get down
To my doomed loving bound
And I realize
That all my dreams are gone

Temptation, flirtation
Am I gonna lose my reputation?
Don’t show your denial
‘cause you make me wanna feel like crying

It's not the way that you use when you look at me
Not the way you walk
Your eyes got something that makes me feel good

You've got to know they're so clear and bright
They seem keep on calling on my name
And it's not the color of your hair
That will keep me sleepless into my bed

Everytime you will step in my life
I will gonna stay up late
'Till the morning
Everytime you will take me so high
My desire just don't wanna wait
'Till you're coming - Here

It's not the way that use when you stare at me
Not the way you walk
Your voice got something that makes me feel good

And in my dreams I can see you
And I can even touch you
I need you so much I'm longing to watch you
Walking just towards me

I'm ready to cross all the oceans with you
I'm ready to walk on the moon
Just take me hand and show it to me
We will go together and forever
Live forever all together

Make it make it make it
Make it allright
Take me take me take me
Take me up there with yo
Baby baby baby I wanna go
Time is on our side
'Cause you're king of paradise

And in my mind I can feel you
And I can even hear you
I need you so much I'm longing to watch you
Walking right by my side

Yes I remember the time
We were so young and we had no rules
I'm looking for brighter days
Hoping the things now could change

Can't you feel it

Life is turning all around us
In a moment everything can change now
Feel the wind is blowing on our shoulder
You can let go of yesterday
And spread out your wings now

Fly-y-y
Forget the troubles we can shine
Fly high the sky
And we can fly-y-y
'Cos now the time and we can try
Forget today and focus only tomorrow

Fly-y-y
Forget the reasons of our life
Fly high tonight
And we can fly-y-y
Just feel alive and don't you cry
Forget the blues and find a dream we can follow

Yes now we're floating on air
We're flying higher above the blue
Don't ever mind of the rain
And what we can just go through

Close to my heart - close to the end and the start
Deep in my soul - deep in my needing for more

There is my lonely feeling
There is my deeper love for you
The pain the hesitation
Yes you love, no you don't
Are you in love with me

Make a move, make a move now
Dont waste your time and
Feel the mood, feel the mood now
It won't last forever
I can tell, can tell you how
To make love to a man
A man in love with you

Give me your hand - you know I will understand
Don't waste your time - I need you now to be mine

Driving down to go clubbing
What do you like to dance?
Radio blasting loud
You feel there is nothing to stop you
On your way
Except the cars in L.A.

You're free, you want to be
Who that is you don't really care
Blue skies on top of you
Blonde and long hair all over you

Sweet sixteen girl
Gonna spread out your wings
It's your chance now to shine
Taste of vodka lemon
Sweet sixteen girl
Keep on discovering
There's so much more in your life
To live and to discover

Driving down Monterey
Where you go to surf
Radio plays Nirvana
You feel there is nothing more cool than this
In your life
Except the clubs in L.A.

You say you are leaving me
You never promised me any decisions
And for your public life I know
It's a shame this love between you and
me

But tell me tell me tell me
What is my role, who am I supposed to
be

Inside this story
Turns out that I'm the loser again
But it won't be the same
This time I know it's gonna be...

Scandal
I see my faces on the magazines
Flashes on me
I wanted to keep this love a secret for
you and me
Got to do to you what you did to me
Gonna be a
Scandal
I see the world is falling down on you
Shooting at you
I'd never wanted to kill the man kill the
man I love
But I got to do what is right for me
What is right for me

You say I am just a fool
You say I've never get the situation
But the moments that we share
Only I know what they meant to me

Anytime you want, to turn me on
Anything you want you just can get it all
When I kiss your lips I start to shiver
Can't control me deep inside

Maybe, maybe I'm a dreaming girl
Nothing matters without you
When I'm in your arms 
I'm happy and I just don't care
'Cos we have a special new world to share

But when I'm feeling blue
And all I have to do
Is take a look at you
Then I'm not so blue
And when you're close to me
Is when I can feel your heart beat
A eurobeat kind of love

Anytime I need I feel you inside
Anything I need you just will give me all
When I hear you breathing near my body
All I want is you beside

I live my days in new century world
I want to feel in love
Got to change my future
Crazy the world I'll be loosing control
I need a laser gun, I'm a cosmic rider

Living in the dark
I'm restoring the light
C'mon baby give you a sign
Forever
Living in the crime
You don't survive
I will fight for you tonight
You can remember me

Baby I really got to be free
Space fighter
Because we live in a galaxy war now
Yes I'm gonna be tonight
Space fighter
I'll be killing all the aliens

Baby I really got to be free
Space fighter
We believe in your celestial pride
Yes I'm gonna save your life
Space fighter
I'm super hero tonight

Lost in the night there's no moon in the sky
Computer "know how"
Let me see my way home
Ready to kill, fear is under my skin
I want to save my life, I'm a cosmic rider

Feel fine, hold on
Look out baby, 'cos here I come

Get ready, 'cos here I come
Get ready, 'cos here I come

I never met a boy who makes me feel the way
that you do
It's alright
I never romanced who makes my dreams real
I see that you do
It's unsafe

I'm gonna bring you a new love that's true
So get ready, so get ready
I'm gonna try to make you love me, too
So get ready, so get ready, 'cos here I come
Get ready, 'cos here I come
(I'm on my way)
Get ready, 'cos here I come

You wanna play hide and seek we'd loved I
That made me remind you, it's alright
The love and you'tr gonna miss in the time
That takes to find you
It's unsafe

So feel good in day, feel good in dawn
Look out baby, 'cos here I come

I'm gonna try to make you love me, too
So get ready, so get ready, 'cos here I come
Get ready, 'cos here I come
(I'm on my way)
Get ready, 'cos here I come

One of my friends who want you, too
I understand it
It's alright
I hope I'll get to do before
she do the way I planned it
It's unsafe

Hey boy you're making makin' me cry
In the heat of the night
This is the power of love
And it's deep in my mind

Open up your heart to me, boy
Hold the key
Listen to your heart
It's beat is running always faster

Never say forever
In losing the pain and the sorrow
I wanna tell you
Never say forever
Together again when tomorrow comes

Hey boy don't leave me tonight
I've got nothing to hide
And this is the power of love
Till the end of the time

Look inside my heart
You will see, all of me
Baby you're my only one
You're my sun, pretty shining

Many nights and day were falling far behind
Uh - oh -uh - oh - uh - oh
But the time will change if you come back again
You have to do it

Day after day, many words I can say
Only you can help me through, baby
Day after day, what I know, what I pray
When I'm blue, I'm without you

You can go so far
Body thrill, what I feel
Baby you're my only one
You're my sun, pretty shining

I'd thought I'll be the one to make you stay
To change your way of living, in everyday
And I can't think about you so far away, tonight, I'm alone

I don't wanna hurt you, I feel so much I miss you
How can I survive? touch me... feel my love inside

I don't wanna loose you now, I don't want another love
Now that I've found you, nothing can be the same
I don't wanna loose you now, baby, let me sing it loud
Now that I've found you... don't say goodbye

Remember you so happy by my side
It's a such a strong emotion, I can't denied
And now the fear is filling up my heart, tonight, I'm alone

I've found you... I've found you... I don't wanna loose you I've found you, babe I've found you... I don't wanna loose you

There is something on my mind I will tell you lady
Wanna spend with you some time, what about a week end?

One, you're the only one
Two, people who just met
Three, days is all I got
Let me feel

Crazy love let me feel for you this crazy love
Now you got me in chains and I would give you my love
'till I do believe, 'till I really feel I was made for this
Crazy love let me feel for you this crazy love
Now you got me in chains and I would give you my love
'till I do believe, 'till I really feel that I was made for you

Stay with me and you will find something precious baby
Wanna make you cross that line, gimme just a weekend

Victim of time time of my life
You are the reason of my crying
You're moving like a fire and now
I can feel your silence of love

Catch me and treat me like a promised man
Anyway you are the only one
And do it just for me
Now keep it in your mind
I see the light inside my heart

Wake up your heart and FEEL THE PASSION
Like your dreams
Don't cry and listen
Changing my time I FEEL THE PASSION
Don't you feel
Don't you feel the passion

Special delight (like) light in the sky
You're in my mind, you're in my life
Time after time you change my nights
Don't you feel me just for one day

Fell like a liar 'cause the people don't know
Into the fire 'cause I know you still love me.

I wouldn't leave ya' cause I care about you
I have no chances gotta go and forever.

I've been from east to west I've never
Found the key to lock it...
My heart is broken 'cause I leave without a word to say...

I DID IT FOR LOVE. I kept the secret in to my heart for so
long.
I DID IT FOR LOVE. I've got the pain 'cause I had to stay
behind.
...... I DID IT FOR LOVE....

Into the future won't live without you.
Into the future won't live in this hot pain.

How does it hurts me when I think about him,
He's used to touch you like I've never done before.

I don't like the game that we play as human logic
Daily changes to justify the things we are doing
All is in the name of of the strongest word
We've got on this earth now

Every girl and every man
Do everything in the name of loving
Every killing, every kiss is looking good
I don't like this point of view

IN THE NAME OF LOVE
And everything is in the name of biggest world
That Jesus gave us
IN THE NAME OF LOVE
And everytime is like a kick into my heart
I want to fight it

Listen to the beat of my heart, it tells no lies
Got the power to know, it's not misunderstanding
All is in the name of the strongest word
We've got on this earth now

No more remorse, no more.
No more illusions only say goodbye
I'm leaving
I don't wanna love your world
I don't wanna show you everything
I've got inside me

Time's going straight to break my heart
I just can't help it
Why don't you treat me as a friend?
That's why I just say

Help me to say goodbye wo ooh ooh
ooh oh oh
Don't take me down down baby

Every time you deny my love
Every time you would be alone
You don't care of my deeper feelings
Baby you tell me why

You don't remember when we were
so good
You don't remember my loving
But I will be forever by your side
By your side waiting for you

Baby you tell me why

Baby didn't mean to hurt you
I don't wanna make you cry
You might not to love me anymore
Or forgive what I've done

When I saw you dance with him
together
And I know and I know you like it
When I think of you together
I am scared about loosing you

I'm a jealous guy you know it
I'm a jealous guy you know
And I lost my control and I lost my
control
And my heart beating fast when I see
you together
I'm a jealous guy you know it
I'm a jealous guy you know
And I'm losing my soul and I'm losing
my soul
I am dreaming the past coz I know
you where lovers

Baby I didn't mean to hurt you
I don't wanna make you cry
Can you understand me because love
Is not easy to hide

I had a dream about those times
I was the only one for you
And there was no limits for your affection
Watching the pictures on the wall
Thinking about the days gone by
And all the promises for the future

It's a message that I send to you
I would (need) just a chance to do
Anything that I have never done for you

Lost in the time
Lost in the days we spent away
They will never come again
(I) Lose the reasons to survive 'cause I'm living lost in the time
I can't find the words to say
'Cause I'm lost in the time

Love letters written on the sand
Eating and making love again
And all your kisses just for a present

You don't love me, better I go
You don't want me, better I know
I can see you in your eyes I got no chance to do
You won't break my heart for nothing

And no matter if I love you (no, no)
And no matter if I need you (no, no)
You don't want this man to show you
How much is crazy for you

Just for tonight
Just for tonight if your love is right
I wanna make you love, just for tonight
Let me give you moments of passion, in your life
For your life
Just for tonight
Just for tonight if the time is right
I wanna give you love, just for tonight
'Cause I know the way you can feel me deep inside
Only for tonight

'Cos I want you, only tonight
Forget about it, just for tonight
I can see in your eyes I got no chance to do 
You won't break my heart for nothing

Seems like I was made for this life just you and me
Feeling so good
Seems like the perfect love in this world of give and take
You never know

All of a sudden I get
Crazy, mad and fierce, here I am
All of sudden I get so dangerous
Taken by my jealousy

It's the same old feeling - don't surrender
The same old grieving - grows my anger
The same old story - I leadner to fight myself
Letting myself go - born to a new life

It looks like everything is normal here again
All is ok!
But now you look at me and you don't know what to think
You never know

Look into my eyes
Can you see the meaning of my desire?
Tell me what's your name
Tell me what's your flame right in the fire

This. the only way that I know
To live my life and get no stress
Yes I want to feel all the pressure
'Cause I need the beat inside

UNDER PRESSURE
Changing my direction but not for fashion
Baby you will never know
UNDER PRESSURE
Waking up myself to get hot the tension
Steady down is not for me

Working all the day
Working like a maniac into the riot
Eating all my time
Having no more chances to make that longer

I play a wisdom
On my pillow here tonight
And the whisper in your ears
Will come to you baby

Gonna keep you in my arms
And then never let you down
Time is changing here tonight
We'll be running through the fields
And I'll say

Satisfy my soul baby
Satisfy my heart
We could always be together
In the name of love
Satisfy your passion lady
Won't you come to me
Walking through th winds of changes
Satisfy to be together

Love is thunder
That will take us to the see
Up the mountains of this world we're gonna make it

Hot girl, burning like the fire
Don't waste your loving for me

To spend together with you

And everybody laughed
But I just held it on
Yes I remember that...

Time after time in my mind and
Night after night I've repeated
High in the sky (I) wanna try my "superfly"

May after may I was reckless
High in the sky (you) gonna see my "superfly"
And you will surely see me higher

I played in my band, everything was truly hand to me

Nothing's like power of love

They walk around but they don't feel what we are in now
'Cause it just can't be found
I'm very proud of what we have and of what we will
Together again

You would always win the fight,

Bang bang, you shoot me down
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shoot me down

Seasons came and change the time

You would always laugh and say
Remember when we used to play

Bang bang, I shot you down
Bang bang, you hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, I used to shoot you down

Music played and people sang
Just for me the church bells rang…

Now he's gone I don't know why
And 'till these days sometimes I cry
He didn't say goodbye
He didn't take the time to lie

Bang bang, he shot me down
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down

Why don't you feel the sound, why can't you hear me?
The colour of the sound is my passion
Why don't you call me now, I need your music

And now that you're ready to leave me, yes my mind is clear
And now that I've really lost you every word is here
And when you told me 'No, I don't wanna go' I became so strange
And when you gave me love all the love you've got just I've not
Replayed

Look at me right now I'm in the dark
My turn came some how you broke my heart

Yes, I know it's too late for love
Bye bye good-bye - Bye bye good-bye
I miss you too
You don't miss me
You just won't knock at my door
'Cause you know it's too late for love

I just love your chest where I lay my face
So I hear the beating of your heart
I need to confess my favorite place
It's where I really feel you

Darling, darling, you're my shinin' tresure
I can help to kiss your tender
Darling, darling, I do feel the power
Coming from my love

To the beating of your heart
To the beating of the rain I say to God
Please don't stop this magic moment
To the beating of your heart
To the ringing of those bells I pray the Lord
Please just let him live forever

Sometimes you're unreal
Sometimes you're my meal
Sometimes you're the perfect place to be
Unlike other men unlike most of them
I find you full of passion

Take another side of me
Take another part of me tonight
And you will see my needing, bade
Chose another destiny
Chose another aspect of your mind
And you will see my needing, babe

Hush, don't be unkind
Gimme another moment to show you
the state of my crush
Gimme more time
Gimme a chance to leave all behind

Euroheat
Take on me, take on you, take it on
Destiny
And tonight I will it my own
Way to be
Calling to me, calling you, calling on
Euroheat

Free yourself and let it be
Free yourself enjoy your time tonight
And you will feel love is not over
Try another way to see
Having fun is not always a crime
As you can see I am your lover

Get me to your world my baby
Get me with you to see
All the good things you've created
Show them all to me

Seems fantasy in my mind, ain't reality
But it's real what I feel
Is right next to me, and I see it

I wanna thank you for the nice fairy tale
You've create for me
I wanna thank you for the magic
Which is when you're loving me

I'm gonna live inside this nice fairy tale
You donate to me
I'm gonna live forever in this dream
You dedicate to me

Keep me in your world my baby
Keep me with you to live
All the good vibes we're creating
When we hug and kiss

You keep on asking me
Why can't we be together
I keep saying won't you wait a while
What's all the hurry
I thought we had forever
I just need time 'till I can make up my mind

I'm not asking for
A love to last forever
I don't expect to get a guarantee
It's just that I believe
Lovers should stick together
I'm only saying
Won't you wait for me

I've got to be
Got to be certain
I've got to be so sure
I've had my share of hearts broken
And I don't wanna take that any more

I've got some friends who say
Boys are all the same
They're only looking out for just one thing
I'm only hoping that
You won't turn out like that
I need some time 'til I can make up my mind

Been hurt in love before
But I still come back for more
I was such a fool
I couldn't stop myself
If you believe in me
If you want our love to be
I know you'll wait for me, oh, oh, oh, oh

Hey I see what I got
I got the staying power
I'll cover you with flowers

Tell me what you feel
You know I love you much
I need your touch

Make it make it move
'Cos we got to know each other
And we got plenty of time

We got the staying power!!!

Give me the night you give me the night
Come on you can shock me with feelings baby
Give me the night you give me the night
You can make me lose control

Give me the night you give me the night
You and me a dynamite bomb together
Give me the night you give me the night
Boy I'm going to give you my soul

Hey I see what I got
I got all what we need
I'll be the one who Ieads

Tell me if it's real
'Cos I got what it takes
Let me use it

Babe tell me is it true?
Do you really want to leave me?
I could never hear you say goodbye
Can't stand the heartache

If you should go
Where do I turn to
Without your love
My life is over
Don't run away
I feel so lonely, give me one more try

Because
SUnshine is not the same without you
Tell me you cannot live without me
It's so hard to face it
I can't stand without your love

C'mon darling don't be cruel
Let's not waste our life together
We must give our love a fighting chance
And start it over

In my life I know
Some time it's hard to say hello

Work abroad, an opportunity
To make my dreams yeah come true
But I love you wish to stay

Help me to say no

Help to say no help to say no
Help me to protect this crazy love

I don't wanna go I don't wanna go
I don't wanna waste our time together
Help me to say no help me to say no
Help me to conserve this magic love forever

In my life I know

Brain tells me to go
But it's so hard now trying to forget you

Break me up tear me down shake me up to

You're the one I need to help me

Make me feel that you still love me
Please make me believe

All the memories of love come abck to haunt me
All the tears I cry for you are fallin' day by day

All my life searching for someone
All my heart given to that one
Now you're gone and I just can't go on

Lonely days here without you by my side
I feel so lonely I could cry
If only you could come back here and make things right

Lonely night to dream about you
Lonely night without your love
Holding on to break up sadness and survive
Lonely night made of desire
Lonely night I'm in my own
Desperately wanting you break here for me

Where are you? I'm trying to reach you
I feel so blue, 'cause I cannot touch you
In my life I never felt this way

Don't worry don't worry
I'll be always by your side

And never say sorry
I don't have that kind of pride
The love that i feel for you will never fade away
The love i feel, is stronger now than ever

You're the reason why i live
You're the only thing i need to say that i am still alive
To say that now i will survive

Is in the air, is bright like the sunshine
Is in my hands, like water i'll be drinking
Is in my mind, and now is clear as never before
I need you to loving you, as my breath of love
I need you to loving you, as my breath of love

Don't worry, don't worry
I'll be always near to you

And never say sorry
I won't judge the things you'll do

The love that i feel for you will never slide away
The love i feel, is deeper now than ever

Stop thinking of you stop dreaming of you
Get start a new tomorrow
Take a look in my heart take a look in my soul
I just don't wanna be too blue

But when I see your face I feel sorrow
I can't resist to your eyes so bright
I'm read to give up to give you my love
Just to you you're my

Love boy stirring up my emotions
I should have never mess myself with one like you
Bad bow causing me a commotion
Love boy like you (just like you)

Stop thinking of you stop dreaming of you
I won't give in to your law
Take a look in my heart take a look in my soul
I just don't wanna feel too down

No more love

Down, down
I am feeling so down
I know that now it's over
And I just can't let you go

Blue, blue
I am feeling so blue
And I keep thinking over you

Don't go
I am sad and lonely
Don't you know
That you no can kill me
Don't go too much fast away from me

No no no, no more love for me baby
No more love for me the rest of my life
Cos my love is you
And forever
I can't live
Lonely without you

No no no, no more love for me baby
No more love for me the rest of my days
Cos my love is you
Cos my heart is you
What I can do without you?

No no no, no more love for me baby
No more love for me

Down, down
Like I am underground
I'm crying more than ever
And I just can't stop the rain

Blue, blue
And it's all about you
I really don't know what to do

Now that you're gone don't try to come down down baby
Jump on the wall than you can go run run running
Up to the sky and there you will find find all the
Peace and love you need to fly

Leaving this earth you just tell us bye bye your way
Spelling no words and don't know why why we cannot
Stop to cry I made up my mind when that
Music was breaking my heart

Only lonely unsafe nights for the love
Where nobody could take what you deserved
Only butlers to draw the curtain down
To hide the Queen but you are the Queen!

Lady lady you've never known oh-no
Lady lady you've never seen
Together for a one day queen
Rewriting history by millions of your fans

Lady lady stopping the world ye-ye
Lady lady smashing your dream
Forever, ever one day queen
Forever like you have been and ever like we feel

Flashes no more that shot you there bang bang's landing
Out with the show you did leave a bad land for a
Wonderful world and there you will find find all the 
peace and love you need to fly

Feel likes the first kiss
No one can better than this
Feels like the first night
We're together

Only now is much stronger
I wanna love, I wanna have you
Long and longer

I remember on my skin
I remember everything
Shivers on my back
For the way we made love

All the moves, that you do
And what I say it's true

Please forgive me
Please forgive me baby
Please believe me co's I can't stop loving you
And every word you say, you and every breath you do
I still holding on I can't move on
Without your loving

First time our eyes met
The old same feeling I get
Feels like the first touch
Like a fever

So if you're feeling lonely
I'll make it good, more than I should
The one and only

Hot sticky scenes, you know what I mean
Like a desert sun that burns my skin
I've been waiting for you for so long
Open the sky and let her come down

Here comes the rain
Here comes the rain
Here she comes again
Here comes the rain
I love the rain
I love the rain
Here she comes again
Here comes the rain

Hot sticky scenes, you know what I mean
Like a desert sun that burns my skin
I've been waiting for you for so long
Open the sky and let her come down

Oh, rain
Rain
Rain

This is all I have of you there is nothing I can do
Since you left without a word you're only in my memories
And it's hard to believe you have found away to leave
So I find myself clung to remember of your kissing

Nothing really matters and nothing could explain it
But wherever you are in someone else's heart
You know the true love's for once

Kisses on the sand just you and me
Kisses as a promise I would keep
Wishes we made with lips in that summertime
Over and over darling

You know kisses never lie. Our love will never die
After all those magic times I realized you were mine

Round, round I get around round
I got to spin around you all my love bombs
Down, down I get on down, down
I get on, let's get down and go get go!

Come on are you ready, well are
you ready
make it up and don't waste your time
'cos I'm on the loose and I'm looking for
some troubles
you know I'll make it good, you'll know that

Round & round & round & round
I'm the best my babe
Round & round & touch me too much
and forget the rest my babe

Round, round I get around round
soon it is round your street that
I am creepin'
Down, down I get on down down
I get on wake you up is no time for sleepin'

Last night a little dancer
Came dancin' to my door
Last night my little angel
Came pumping on the floor
He said a "Come baby
I've got a license for love
And if it expires
Pray help from above"
Because

In the midnight hour
He cried more, more, more
With a rebel yell
He cried more, more, more
Owwww
In the midnight hour, babe
More, more, more
With a rebel yell
More, more, more
More, more, more

He don't like slavery
He won't sit and beg
But when I'm tired and lonely
He sees me to bed
What set you free
And brought you to me, babe
What set you free
And brought you to me, babe
What set you free
I need you here by me
Because

In the midnight hour
He cried more, more, more
With a rebel yell
He cried more, more, more
Owwww
In the midnight hour, babe
More, more, more
With a rebel yell
More, more, more
More, more, more

I walk the ward for you, babe
A thousand miles with you
I dried your tears of pain
A million times for you
I'd sell my soul for you, babe
For money to burn for you
I'd give you all and have none, babe
Just a, just a, just a
To have you here by me
Because...

In the midnight hour
She cried more, more, more
With a rebel yell
She cried more, more, more

In the midnight hour, babe
More, more, more
With a rebel yell she cried
More, more, more
More, more, more

Oh yeah little baby
She want more
More, more, more, more, more

Oh yeah little baby
She want more
More, more, more, more, more

Hey, it's you I can't believe it's really you
I can't believe you talk to me
But I guess you have called for her

What can I tell ya? you know... thing are the same here
No news, time passes by and I still have my little chance
to find the love

Oh! yes you've called just to check
If she had noticed your secret love
And you wanna know if she's OK so
You're right asking me...

She has many friends to go with
We're okay, I'll really take good care of her
We'll be fine

I don't know why you don't look around yourself
A true love might be close to you
Closer than you have ever guessed

From the deep of my heart
It's coming out
An unchained melody

And in the core of my head
Sounds so loud
The song that I want to sing

It's dedicated to my love
It's for you and me
I wanna yell it to my lord
Stuck into my mind and my soul

Sing song sing song

Listen to what I say

Forever and ever now

You can make all my days
Be with me
My love will be very loud

Please don't say no - I want you to know
Everytime we kiss I feel the
Emptiness and loneliness
Filling up my life - with tears

Listen to me . 'cause I won't give in
You can keep our love from dying with
Lovely kisses tenderness
Make me feel your love - is real

And everything I'll do - I'll do it for you
Because I love you so
Oh baby baby tell me what to do
I need to feel you

Take me to your heart - take me to your heart
Open up your mind and let me in
Unseal your soul to me
Show me what I got - to do

Take me to your heart - take me to your heart
Open up your mind I need the key
Unlock your soul to me
Show me I'm the one you need

Gimme the chance - to save our romance
I am trying to make our love not
Fall apart with all my heart
Make you feel my love - is real

Keep standing in the dark
All alone and waiting
The captain of my heart
Keep listening to the sound
Of my poor damaged heart
But I won't no more

Keep waiting in the dark
But you just ain't calling
I know with who you are
Keep listening to the sound
Of my poor tender heart
I will lock the door

And I'm used to the abuse
To figure my life
As I've nothing to lose
Without you
I've abused of the use
To feeling alone everywhere
'Cos you just don't care

Stop, teasing my heart
'Cos I know who you are
But you don't feel sorrow
Stop, teasing on me all time
Hope the wind and the rain
Will take all of my pain away

You're the boy I've ever wanted
You're the only one who gives me chills
I couldn't find around the world
Somebody just like you

Some people say our love is unbelieveble
How could I think to keep your love
But I am not afraid because I know I
know that you are

Too cool to fall in love
With another girl
Too much sure about me

Too cool to fall in love
Lose the love you've found
Too much in love

I was meant to care about you
You were born to fall in love with me
Nobody could tear us apart
Our love is like a rock

Dancing in my room
I keep on thinking on our night together
Waiting over the phone
For you to call me now or maybe later

But the night is almost over
While I smoke a million cigarettes

You're unforgettable... animal
You are my destiny... come to me
You took my breath away... just to say
I couldn't live without your love

You're unforgettable... you I want
You are my destiny... you I need
You took my breath away... all the way
I couldn't live without your love

Dancing on my own
I keep on waiting for you to come over
Sleeping near the phone
I wonder if you'll come tonight or never

It's yes
'Cos I'm waiting for your call
It's no
Don't you want me anymore
Maybe
But you won't regret it because
I'll never leave you

You say you still want me into your world
And I'm a girl that can't be put on hold
Oh boy now you gotta make up your mind
Cause you,re running
Out of time

Shut your mind off just for a while tonight
Cause I wanna your attention right this time
Yes or no, now you got to decide
If I would give up on you then you'll be fine?

Yes I will
I will give up on you with tears in my eyes
But tonight

Yes I will
You're messing with my heart cause I love you still
But yes I will

It's yes
We belong together, love
It's no
What is it you're waiting for
Maybe
But you know I'll always be there
I won't deceive you

Even if you went away now
I still care I can't forget you
Even if you cannot hear me
I would send a message to you

First I hated all about and
Than I tried to get you out

But now ....
But now ....
But now ....
Oh babe ....

When I close my eyes
I see the rainbow in the sky
I feel the wind on me
I hear your voice so sweet again oh babe ....

When I close my eyes
I see your face on trough the nights
I feel your love on me
And than I know I'm not alone
When I close my eyes

Even if I can't contact you
I still try to say I love you
Even if you can't come back now
I belive we'll together

Rainy days on my hair without you
Sunny days on my skin around you
I feel better when I remember
yesterday yeeh

Memories in my heart how does
that feel
Memories in my mind seems to be real
What a wonderful tale about
my yesterdays

In the night I was awake for love
But I had no fear to break my heart
In the light of burning summertimes
When I had the life in.....

Remembering "Yesterday" I had a dream of you
I gave your love away but I belong to you

Funny faces a pictures in my hand
Crazy races to play ball on the sand

Once upon a time
in ancient Palestine
so does the legend say
God sent down a note
and this is what he wrote
"Noah rig up the sail"

Get the message through
to my friends out in the jungle
Birds! Bears! Bees! and
all the Chimpanzees
Got to get to cover
before the day is over
And so...
Two by two by two by two!

Two by Two by Two the lions came
Two by Two by Two the cats
Two by Two by Two the elephants
Two by Two by Two the rats

You should be aware
said Noah to bear
we're going on a trip
soon it's gonna rain
but let them be the same
for those aboard the ship

Ararat I'm told is to be
our destination

As we were meant to be
Say we'll never part
And now I feel so free
Dancin' on my dreams
I'll open up my heart and
Won't let you go

Can't you feel around such a fizzy charm
Dancin' on the wings of your lovin'
Lift you off the ground to the sky so high
To the starlight

Right a boom
A bomb into my heart on fire
Bigga boom
We've never felt heaven before

Big sensation, bigga boom
Baby got a crush on you
Smilin' every day
And lovin' the night away
Big emotion, bigga boom
Never more I'm feelin' blue
Dancin' every way

Sayin' out your name like a weirdo
Crazy girl I'm gone and it's all for you
For your lovin'

Baby ready for me

And you mean so much to me
Everytime you dance on the dance floor
Body to body

And I really can't tell the time
You're steppin' on my heartbeat - heartbeat
And you really can catch my eye
Whenever you're around

Movin' to the music
Standing' out from everybody

If you close your eyes
Can you really fly?
Tell me now

Who's that girl? Well I!
Champion of the best selling lies

And now we're dancin' together
Together just you and I
My life was sad and so depressing
Without you to make it fun

Come on we're dancin' together
Together just you & I
The world will need a little fancy
With your love to make it run
We're goin' dancin' together

Look into my eyes
Baby can it be
You can see the magic around you

If you make a wish
Smiling at the sky
There you are!

It's a feeling I can't keep inside
It's a new emotion
Every time I feel so lovey-dovey
I'm so happy I just hit the ceiling

I don't know why
Why I feel so lucky
What a surprise
I'm not a dreaming
It's a beautiful day
It's a beautiful life

Boomin' crazy I just gotta scream it

Starman on a skyride
Flashin' in the night time
Any place any day you call
Come on take me higher
Got to stay together and fly away
Reachin' into the light

Time for a change I need your oxygen
One touch of magic fallin' on me
Feelin' your longing, I can hear you callin'
The time is right, time is right
Jump into the light

Into the light, into the light
No dark and lonely night
Gotta feel what I feel for you, baby
Into the night, into the light
I'm flyin' every night
I'm feelin' right

Waiting for my lover
I can feel your power
Faraway many moons from me
Daddy can't discover
Baby's comin' over to set me free
Take me into the light

Everybody come on
Get your feet on the floor
Catch the fever, dance tonight
Move your bodies in time
Just for once in your life
Let the no-no generation behind

You'll dig the music over and over
If you can feel the fun
Come take your body round
Into the night we're comin' together
Dancin' to the rhythm forever

Gonna make you feel like heaven's in your heart
High on your lovin'
Send me to the stars
The night is tender

On the wings of love

I'm livin' in the light of eternal love
Baby why,

(High on the wings of your lovin')

Can it be magic
If I tell you all my dreams and fantasy
Just keep on dreamin'
Gonna fly tonight
Deep in the blue light

Can't resist that crazy feeling, why
Do I pretend you're just a friend
When all I want is kiss the way I do,
Me and you, babe

And in the midnight hour you'll feel a secret call
Surrender to desire
Feel like losin' control

You'll need to stay by my side 'cause
Love is magic
Can't survive
Feelin' so heavenly 

I'll be what you like 'cause
Love is magic
Touch the sky
Higher and higher

Gotta be mine 'cause
Love is magic
In your arms
Be what is gotta be

You'll stand by my side 'cause
Love is magic
Can't survive
Love what I'm feelin'

Wanna be the one my baby, hey
You cannot stop or walk away
Now you belong to love just the way you do,
Say it's true babe

I see you smilin'
You can bring the sunshine
You're too pretty, baby, to be on your own
It's such a feeling
Say that I'm not dreamin'
Don't you know I focused on yourself alone

You must be lonely
Standin' on the top now,
Why don't you call on me?
Beautiful and dancin'
Leave it baby all to me to me

Hey Mr. Nice Guy
You will be mine
I say I'll be your nice little lady
Hey Mr. Nice Guy

You're such a wonder
Glitterin' the night time
I just need the feelin' of you're lovin' hands
You're a sensation
Set my heart in motion
Show me that you want me baby like I do

Beautiful life
Never have tasted it so fine
Open, my heart
Lettin' my ego time to fly

I breathe the air and the sky
Feelin' my lips in the sunshine, and my
Arms are open wide

Me, myself and I
Invincible peace of mind
Me, myself and I
Inside is my power
Me, myself and I
My heartbeat, I'm still alive
Me, myself and I
And time is forever

Wind in my hair
Vibratin' emotion on my skin
Bamboo body
The energy's in your soul of steel

Boulevard of broken dreams
I walk in disillusion
Still my life's mystery
All passion and confusion

I'm gonna try
Take this piece of my life
To shape my destiny
'Cause the power in me
Is the power of dreams
I'll never let them go and
Face the world alone

The story of my life
And all the world can't stop my lonely flight
Look into my eyes
The story of my life
A dream of never-ending glory
Lost in the night
The story of my life
And all the world can't stop my flyin' high
Look into my eyes
The story of my life
A dream of never-ending glory
Let the light shine on me

Burnin' up all memories
I'll take away the sorrow
If you got me on my knees
I'm living for tomorrow

Rain
Sweet
Fall down on me
Tears from the sky
Down my smile

Before you came
I thought I'd never love again
But now
I feel
I'm free without a chain

Rain
Come wash away the pain
My face is wet and I
Don't mind
I'm feelin' strong again

Rain
The losses and the gain
Will never be the same
I know
The name of all the game

Dark
Blue
Clouds over there
Are goin' away
For today

Summer sun is beatin' on me
Burnin' heavy with the heat
Everybody's gone away
It's a lonely Saturday

Born again in a white snow plain
Just fancy I'll be there with you

Summer ski
Is livin' in a dream
Summer ski
So cool and so refreshin'
Be yourself in nature's harmony
Summer ski
It's heaven you can feel

Every day I'm gonna be there
Work my way through all the cares
I can feel the pressure high
Somethin' missin' in my life.

Oh what a feeling
Gonna make you feel like haven's in your heart
High on your lovin'
Send me to the stars
The night is tender

Why, You're my paradise
I just wanna wake up in the morning light with you
I pray that you let me be forever
On the wings of love
Flying to you

Livin'all my life to be your angel
I found you in paradise
Open up my arms to be your angel
One and a million times
Livin'all my life to be your angel
I found you in paradise
Open up my arms to be your angel
One and a million times

Can it be magic
If i tell you all my dreams and fantasy
Just keep on dreamin'
Gonna fly tonight
Deep in the blue light
long

All day I've been searchin' my way up
Black heavy clouds hangin'over my cup
I run far from the people around me
Everybody's crazy

But now forget about them
I need my touch of heaven
Just relax and think of you boy
Sendin' out my message baby

When u smile
There's nothing else but blue sky
When u smile
A ray of sunshine warm light
When u smile
I feel my heart can fly high
When u smile
My paradise is here tonight

Hey now dream away all the sorrow
I think of you and tomorrow's the time
You bring back all the colours to my day
Everybody's happy

Day by day, growin' up till
I know this time
Will be forever

Seems like
My mind
Reachin' up to fly
Is ready to leave here

Wings into the sky
You'll leave it all behind
Look at the world now
So innocent and wild
Wings into the sky
No one can tell you why
You have to go, now
And take your chance to fly

Feel the wild, feel the summer breeze
Around you
Promise forever

I'm livin' for tonight
I'll do or die - uooh
Gona make it so fantastic
I'm gonna meet my friends
My dude is there - uooh

On the wings of a butterfly
And if you're feelin' happy

Wavin' the pain goodbye

Ye ye ye yeah -

Ye ye ye yeah -
I'm gonna feel the lights upon me
Baby crazy goin' hazy

I wanna feel the bang inside oh
Babe crazy gettin' hazey,

You're gonna make it fine
Your star is bright - uooh
All aflame and so bombastic
Follow the rhythm right
We'll move in time - uooh
Baby work it out

Money can't buy
The love of my life
And pay me a diamond tear
Bingo you shout
Then take a knock-out
And cry you don't have the gear

So take it all, ups and downs
Relax just movin' in and out of luck, now
Hold on tight, go  your way and baby
Keep yourself ready to love

Easy come & easy go
Now that's livin'
Easy come & easy go
Ain't no stoppin'
Baby movin' on up
Just open your heart to love

Easy come & easy go
Take your time baby
Easy come & easy go
Wheels keep turnin'
You will never get down
This merry go round of life

Right on and on
Got no time to yawn
It's all just a game we play
Ain't comin' down
Just foolin' around
Tonight let me sing out loud

The love in your eyes
The way that you look and smile
I had to be your lover
The story of you & I
Forever in my heart

When the world is on fire
My heart is for you
And waiting for a brand new tomorrow
(I) look for your face and I call out your name
Goodbye everybody
Take my hand we're runnin'

Oh baby
You and I
I see the love in your eyes
Together we smile
Together we cry
We could be so happy forever love
Like fantasy lovers
Children of sky

You and I 
Can't take you out of my mind
Together we run
Together we fly
I just wanna hold you forever love
Like fantasy dreamers 
Children of the sky

I feel so good inside
Baby now I cannot hide
I wonder how I've lived
Without you, girl, before

We're gonna take a chance
I don't know if it's true romance
Now let's forget 'bout broken hearts, my lover

Now celebrate
Come closer baby
And tonight you will dance for me
Now celebrate
You're such a grace
And now I'm feelin' so wild and free

Now celebrate
Come shinin' baby
All my moments belong to you
Now celebrate
This feelin' great
Every dream baby can come true

I know that in my mind
I can find you anytime
I know together
We can make it go real fine

Every morning at the sunrise
Every night under the moonlight
I just thank
Luck again
Bringin' you into my life

When I need to feel the magic
I just close my eyes and fancy
Memories
All my dreams
Livin' till the end of time

Why - when we're close together
Time is only a butterfly
Here in my hand - I got you by my side

I will love you forever
And till the end of time
Look in my eyes now
Say you'll be mine now
Till the end of time
We'll be dancin', romancin'
Until the end of time
Never be lonely
Never be sorry
Now until the end of time

Gimme more that sweet sensation
To have in you my destination
In your arms
Now and till the end of time

Walk in the sunshine
Kiss in the moonlight
Babe, do it to me
I wanna feel what you feel if you want me
Open your heart
And let me love you

All the boys they tried to get me
Just to lay their hands on my dreams
Got to be born the moment you touch me
And saw the light of your lovin'

Lovin' you lovin' me
I'll tell all the world I'm feeling
So heavenly
Lovin' you lovin' me
Lovin' all the way to your heart
I'll fly to you - you know I go

Lovin' you lovin' me
My fantasy child I'm dreamin'
So heavenly
Lovin' you lovin' me
Lovin' all the way to the stars
I'll fly to you
Go straight to your heart - say you're lovin' me

Show me your lovin'
Say what you're feelin' - babe
Tell me you're reak
I wanna know if you know that I need you
Open your mind
And let me love you

Playa del sol
Shinin' like gold
Burnin' on the skin' I'll never let you go
It's like a dance
Move in a trance
Beat ritmo latino gotta take the chance

Step into the night
Don't be so shy
Dancin' on the sand under the pale moonlight

Show you baby how
Gotta follow me now

Ole ole ole, viva la noche
Life is a holiday until tomorrow
Ole ole ole, viva la noche
Just for tonight
Ole ole ole, viva la noche
Sorrow will go away until tomorrow
Ole ole ole, viva la noche
Viva la noche

Fuego, my hips
Move in the heat
Gotta clap your hands, you gotta stomp your feet
Turnin' around
Get in the sound
Dance until you laugh and drop onto the ground

My body is never away
I keep a part of him
In my heart night and day
I feel his touch wherever I go

My boy is tender and true
And he makes everyday of my life
Seem like new
My feelings for him are real
I love him so

Up until the day that I met him
I was just a shy little girl
But he's helping me be come
A woman of the world
Now I know there's nothing for me to be
afraid of
I'm happy to be lost in the mystery of
our love

Somewhere inside my heart is a voice amour
Singing a song that I have never heard
before
Somewhere inside my heart is a mystery
of our love

My boy is handsome and smart
And he has magic eyes
I sigh whenever he touches me

My boy is macho and strong
And I can't wait 'till he
Invites me to the prom
We'll dance close and kiss all night
in ecstasy

In the day, night I feel
Don't you be your life
But tomorrow or this morning
Can be the same
You regret, again and again
My hope is vanishing now, baby

Don't feel you, part of me
Tonight it's late, anyway
I love you, don't refuse me again
Night and day

Can't I love you?
Another baby
Can't I love you?
My wonder baby
Time on, darling
It's every nights
Can't I love you, baby? (yeah)

Now I drive on my own
And my might is fool
I was tough, won't surrender
Until you tell me again
I love you today
Once more together, baby and I

Who's knocking at my door?
I'm feeling in the dark
It could be someone blonde
Who brings me energy

Whenever you're beside me
You try to learn and sign good melodies
And every time you make a mistake, together
We have some fun to live!!!

You're like an angel, give me your heaven
I don't believe your heart is cold as ice
Give me your heaven, I'm not a stranger
(I) see in your blue eyes a human touch on me
You're like an angel, give me your heaven
Blue eyes and pale skin could be just your power
Give me your heaven, I'm not a stranger
Don't keep on saying
"Now you treat me bad"... I'd feel so blue...

I find myself alone
'Cause of my troubled mind
You're ringing at my door
To tell me "I'm feverish"

Don't go breakin' my heart
You don't know what it means for me
Don't be too hard
Don't go breakin' my heart oh no
Please don't hit inside
I'm standin' in your way

I pray to have strength to carry on
But you're closin' your door tonight
And without you now I can't go on
Just forget all your foolish pride
Together we have lived in paradise
I don't need anymore, I don't anymore
Ohh oh why uh uh

Don't go breakin' my heart
You don't know what it.....

You get my love I'm feelin' alright
You surrender my hopes and dreams
And without, you will be a street to climb
I'll forgive that you're lunatic
I don't know why you're making it so wrong
You can't take me no more, you can't take me no more
Oh oh why uh uh

Don't go breakin' my heart
You don't know what it......

Love is a game
Night has my name
Lay on me and touch me over
Take all my flame
Tell me all the words
I want to hear from you tonight, hey!!

Stopping my love fever, angel
While you get to know
Open a door
And give up to keep on closing
Loving you

Harmony
Harmony of love, you deny
Turn around a story
Harmony
Harmony, don't think black and white
Over all, my darling

My lonely day
You only night
And the wind is blowing over
Take me away
Can you fill the season
That I live without you, honey

Now what ya looking for?
Now what ya waiting for?
I can believe in you tonight ahy ahy

I just want more and more
How can you get my love
Dancing together in the night ahy ahy

Baby, feel my desire
Take me into the fire
Push me higher and higher
Don't be lazy, make me fly

Bang bang crashing of the boom boom
Baby, I sing "I love you" in the dark ah ah ah
Bang bang my heart is like a boom boom
Chemical desire in the night

Now what ya living for?
Now you just want to know
Let's feel the rhythm of the night ahy ahy

Now what ya looking for?
You have just found my love
You, take a look into my heart ahy ahy

Cause of me you just can feel all my loving
Guessing you are falling to your sadness
In my life I'm at the heart of dreaming
Shining stars are bright
The moon screams without you

Crying on my shoulder
But don't surrender
Baby set me free
I know this is wrong
Take another way
Cause you can trust me
Give you my dreams
Always in my heart

Running over the night
Waste my time in this life
Drive my car in this town
To reach your love
Running over the night
Screaming, drivin' to the moon
Don't forget me
Forgive me one more time

Hey, don't spend your money
To send a message to your honey

You should be a lightning
To run to her and say "I miss you"

Shake me up and down
I feel you all around
Why don't you see my fire?
Can you hear the sound for dancing all around?
I'm gonna feel you like an emotion now...

Baby, don't cry tonight
You read me deep inside
Because I want to let you know how
And you would like to hold me tight
I see the magic in your eyes

Hey, spend all your time
With me tonight to fill my life

Hey! I need you honey
Because I'm dancing in the fire

If you wanna dance tonight
We'll go to a disco club
We can feel the beat, my sunny baby

Tell me now the reason why
The magic of the sound
Makes you crazy, baby
Like never before

This is the magic of sunshine
You'll never have a broken heart
Staying with me, it's so good
This is the magic of your smile
Dance to the rhythm of my heart
Tonight and tomorrow

If you wanna dance all night
We feel the magic sound
Moving to the beat of crazy rhythm

I can see the blue of your eyes
Under a shining star
I can feel a sunny soul in you
Baby, go!

Everyday in my life

All of you, all of me
Together we can feel the best dreams

Love me tonight, hold me forever
Look at the sky... the moon in your eyes
Give me the best now and forever

To the action, my connection

When we were young and free together
Problems were passing by
Our life was a matter of feelings
There was nothing else to do

People were telling lies about you
I'm the only one to know the truth
Don't worry about what people think of you
Love never fade away don't run away

You gotta free your mind
To see the sunshine coming over you
All over you babe
Take your time, don't lose yourself tonight
Life's not over can you walk with me

You better bring your love
You better show me, show me all your love
Don't be so far from me
You better bring your love
You better show me, show me what you feel
That's all I want for me

When we were young and free together
Problems were passing by
Don't worry about what people think of you
Love never fade away - don't run away

I feel something in my head
I'm walking down around my way
A secret place into my heart
Emotions take me high...

I think, I'm going crazy
I can't remember you in this lonely night
Hey my baby, yes I'm ready, let me fly away

Music
The only thing that I need into my life
Like a perfect diamond shines in the sky
Let me be your lover and make me so wild

Music
The only thing that can save my heart
In this magic dream, free with me
Let the music play now only for me
!!! M u s i c !!!

I can stop the time tonight
I'm looking for a brand new day
Let a chance now into your life
Emotions make me cry

Here tonight, I won't live the ecstasy
To breathe in your loneliness clinging to me
I will sleep, in the way it used to be
And you will not reach me there
Into my dreams, 'cause

I won't dream about you, I won't dream about you
No, I won't dream about you, not anymore

Here tonight, I won't live the luxury
To feel once again the grip of your domain
I'll lay down, like a lotus on a pond
And then on my waking up
I won't be the same, 'cause

I won't dream about you, I won't dream about you
No, I won't dream about you, not anymore

I love in the between reality and dream
Locked behind a door that no one ever could have seen
Ending of a life that should've asked for
More and more...
Needin' more and more and more

Dream about you, I won't dream about you
No, I won't dream about you, not anymore

The secret combination of your heart
Lies in the safe
And for you love is a stranger just don't exsist
You are not free so you've built these walls
You would like to lock me up in the darkness of
Your mind, tell me why, oh yeah

Really you don't know how to give
So you want it all
You believe your're worth is nothing
So you want to rule
The perception of your weakness is my force
And there's just one thing I'm asking to you now
Take a bow, oh yeah

I want freedom give it or break down
Under your law
I want freedom give it or crash down
Under your law, don't say no!

When you want to hrut me you ake aim
Straight to my heart
Hate is your religion you proclaimed
Yourself the God
How you tried to keep me distant from the world
But there's just a little thing I'm wanting from you
Now, take a vow, oh yeah

I want freedom give it or break down
Under your law
I want freedom give it or crash down
Under your law
I want, I want freedom give it or break down under
Your law
I want freedom giev it or crash down
Under your law
Don't say no!

Freedom, give it or break down
Freedom, give it or crash down
Freedom, give it or break down
Freedom, give it or crash down

I want freedom give it or breakd own
Under your law
I want freedom give it or crash down
Under your law
All I want is freedom give it or break down
Under your law
I want freedom give it to crash down
Under your law
Don't say no!
Please don't say no!

Every single day I kneel down and pray
Every single day I look for a way
To find a better em for you and I to see
Running in the fields where I'm free to be
The one I was born

How many hearts I've broken
Just to feel I was alive
What I've left behind
How many heights I've climbed
Just to make my lovers cry
What was in my mind
And what I got here now

How many hearts I've broken
In the search for my own truth
What I've done to you
How many heights I've climd
In the name of my own pride
What was in my mind
And what I've got here now

Every single day I kneel down and pray
Every single day I look for a way
To reach a highest ground that I haven't found
In the words I'm told by the media lords
In the lies unsold by the global whores
The masters of the wars that they won't fight for
The world I was born

Lost in the crowd of every town
Of all the places I am bound
For the troubles left behind
Home I will sleep safe tonight

Up in the sky's a big round
I know you're calling me somehow

I feel you babe, I feel you babe
I feel you, I feel you, Ifeel you babe, babe, babe

I've been never afraid to live
But I fear what death can give
Do I need you by my side?
You might not recue me this time

Up in the sky so loud
I know I'm maybe going down

I feel you babe, I feel you babe
I feel you, I feel you, I feel you babe, babe, babe

You and me, a universe
- every deed we make
You and me, and no one else
- every stance we take
You and me, a universe
- every kiss we give
You and me, and no one else
- everything we live
you and me, a universe
- every vow we take
You and me, and no one else
- every move we make
you and me, a universe
- every doubt we have
You and me, and no one else
- everything's forgave

I feel you babe, I feel you babe
I feel you, I feel you, Ifeel you babe, babe, babe

Listen baby because I don't know where to begin
I have come to you 'cause it's your help now that I need
I don't want to keep on being the devil in disguie
I don't want to hurt you 'cause I can't apologize

I have used the power that is proper for my breed
I've abused man, I had them crawling at my feet
I have bit the apple with no guilt inside my mind
Thinking that to sin was the sweetest juice of life

I have done wrong and I'm ready to pay for my sins
I'll redeem myself for all the mes that I have been
Situations's hurling down and now I need control
Situation calls you more and more

I don't want to keep on lying and I can't deny it
I got self-enjoyment in this sort of decadence
I will never let those evil games recapture me
Because I can't do more than confess the evidence

I need your love, I need your love
I need your love, I need your love

Got to cleanse myself, just before it ends
Baby help me, just forgive me for the way I am
I need to be clean, to prevent to sin
Keep my hands out of the cookie jar, know what I mean

I will turn to good, join the adulthood
I'll re-shape myself as if I was made of clay
And if there's hell to pay for the deeds I've done
Gimme consequence tomorrow
But now I'm begging you to stay

I need your love, I need your love
I need your love, I need your love

Remember that we've gone in place wherever
And don't forget, stay together
Round and round
Don't go down

And I know (I'm)
Loosing you
So I'm crazy too
I want to spend the night together
Open your heart
I wanna go with you inside my mind
Baby

Love is all around
Please don't let me down
Gonna take my bodyt turn it on
When love is all around
Can you feel the sound
Gonna live all your life on my soul
1 (my body) 2 (forever with me)

Get up'n everybody's feel is louder
And don't give up, we are so wonder
Turn me on
My begum

One
Sometimes I'm in Hell
Stuck to the ground
And do way to get up
Two
And I've fed my own greed
Children's tears
Coming out of anger
Three
I am an animal
Longing for what I think I need
Four
Sat on the throne of rage
Railing at a world that's so unfair

Ten worlds I'm living in
Cross my life
TEn worlds I can't give in
Worlds of freedom
But I just can't stand
Just can stand so much

Ten worlds I'm living in
Day by day
This very moment
I'll get the right attitude
But I just can't stand
Just can't stand so much

Five
Sometimes I'm in peace
I'm alive, simply I feel human
Six
A shattering ecstasy
Fills my heart
Water cleanses my face
Seven I want to know everthing
Get in touch with the core of my life
Eight And I can see the light
Conscious thought I've not reached it yet

Ten worlds I'm living in
Through my days
Ten worlds I keep within
State of living
But I just can't take
Just can't take too much

Ten worlds I'm living in
I look inside
And can't see my things
I'll find my way to the truth
'Cause I just scan't stand
Just can't stand so much

Nine
Everyone is here for me to feel
Ten
I understand

Ten worlds I'm living in
Cross my life
Ten worlds I can't give in
Worlds of freedom
But I just can't take
Just can't take too much

Ten worlds I'm living in
Day by day
This very moment
I'll get the right attitude
'Cause I just can't stand
Just can't stand so much

How can I live with all this pain
The secret question's just the same
I'm trapped in these walls so humid and grey
and part of my life is going insane
I don't want to be apart of this game

Give me your hand, give me your mouth
I don't want to be part of the doubt
I'll do what I want, I'll do what I feel
I don't wanna be apart of the wheel
The digital wheel

How can I live with all this shame
My old question's just the same
They can hang me on the wall
To be viewed by all
There's a lesson that I've learned
I don't want to be apart of the whole

Give me your hand, give me your mouth
I don't want to be part of the doubt
I'll do what I want, I'll do what I feel
I don't wanna be apart of the wheel
The digital wheel

If part of my life is going insane
I'll do what I want, I'll do what I feel
I don't want to be apart of the wheel
The digital wheel

I don't want to be afraid, we'll walk together
One step at a time
I just want to be amazed, by this situation
And everything about it
'Cause you got the rainbow

I don't want to give you rules
To make ymself more safe and sure
I'm gonna risk, but here's your share
This situation's got to thrill me all the way
'Cause you got the rainbow
And every single day I will take care of you
You got the rainbow
I won't let you down, but you don't have to ask for more

'Cause everyday you'll be my new dare
And I will get you over time

'Cause everyday I'll be your new bet
And you will keep me here for a while
For a while, for a while
Here with you

I don't want to be a fool, say forever, then break your heart
I just want to live it, in any way, and not keep this situation
on the edge of "leave or stay"
'Cause you got the rainbow
and every single day I will take caer of you
You got the rainbow
I won't let you down, but you don't have to ask for more

You choose the moment, you pick the time
Look in my eyes can't you see that I want you
You choose the moment, you pick the time

If you wait until the end of time it's too late
So wake up from your dream I am the right one
Please look out for me, before I'm gone

Please, my boy, don't leave me down
Without my satisfaction
And never make me physical
Denied in cause of action
I said it once again to you
I wanna make your passion... passion... passion

Listen, (it's) time when you're back
'Cause your life is not that
Take it easy, take a chance with me
Don't go down with your life

And love will turn to passion
A sudden little boy for you

Summer, stronger, my baby like a wonder
Honey, I need you
You walking up and shouting
Over and over
I treat you like a target
Baby, I give you
My every little joyness

Let me go, let me go
I wanna be a star
I'm a dreamer

Let me be, let me be
The champion of the beat competition

We can dance together without limits
Now it's time to play for real, baby
We can play this game without fire
Because I win... I got the power

Lucky star, out of the dark
A good sensation out of control
Lucky night, I feel alright
I am the champion, the star of the night

Let me go, let me go
I'm gonna be a star
I believe it

Let me dream, let me dream
I wanna be the star of the dance floor

Honesty, I wanna give you forever
But the world you live needs a political power
Jungle beat, is flowing deep in my body
All around you move and it can be enough

Dive into my heart, fly over the sky
Let me bet he star of your life
And rock the night
In your paradise, feel in wonderland
Move all bad desire to me
You are the night

Slave to the rhythm, unchain all delights
We got the freedom in magical fire
Slave to the rhythm, unchainning my heart
Take me higher with desire

Suddenly a brightly light in the sky
Appears to me and you for an emotional fire
Feel the groove, and rolling over and over
Keep the beat inside until you make me laugh

A walk in the park, still I'm thinking of you
You sat your spell on me
Burden I cannot bear
We should have lived together

I can't pretend, still I'm waiting for you
There's so much going on
I wish I could go on
We should have stayed together

But I keep movin' on
But I keep movin' on
But I keep movin' on
I've been waiting too long

But I keep movin' on
But I keep movin' on

I've been waiting so long

Sweet pain and pleasure
Imagining us together

Where did we go? We use to be
young in the heart
Life is often not fair, hurts us inside big time
and the memories of us fade away

'Cause I keep movin' on
'Cause I keep movin' on
'Cause I keep movin' on
I've been waiting too long

'Cause I keep movin' on
'Cause I keep movin' on
'Cause I keep movin' on
I've been waiting too long

Sweet pain and pleasure
Imagining us together
Sweet pain and pleasure
Imagining us together

That you must be mine again
Don't even think to still resist me

Final destination to the moon
I'm gonna start my countdown on you
Final exploration of your world
Gonna take control of you

Zero gravity - Out in the space now
Seeking you now out of the world

Ready for the moon - Engine conversion
Breathe the dust of my hot emotion

Pounding in my chest
Shattered pieces my heart
I am coming after you
I am losing my resistance

Baby baby oh

And my blood is running fast
My fever is high
Just one more try

Fighting
Going down for fighting
Can't you hear me screaming
Fighting through the night
Born to be a winner
Fighting
Born to be a fighter
Can't you see me bleeding
Fighting through the night
The night the night

You don't have to cry
Sadness is filling your eyes
I am taking care of you
I am taking on the war now

They have been trying to bite
They've been trying to fight
I have never felt better than that

As soon as riot takes place
Human looses all grace
Then I really see what I am for

I got no cracks you won't sneak into me
to me to me to me
I have no fear I have no tears
I'm like a wall

Solid rock that's what I am
Believe me there's no way to break me down
Love me not never take a chance with me girl
Biggest mistake of your life time

Help! I don't know what it means
In the night I don't dream
Only beef and milk to feed myself

Why don't you start a new war
I'll be ready to roll
Then you'll really see what I am for

Give me your love, I need you
I don't know what to do!
Have to forget that I love
you
Have to except that were
Through

Yesterday when I thought of you
I wasted all of my time
What you did when I wasn't with

You can't forget her
She's all you want for now (get
ready)

And you were right from the start
I know that I have made a mistake
We have to go on apart

You can't forget her
She's that you want for now (get
ready)

More than I can say
More than I can see
More than my life was meant to be

Like the morning light
When you raise a smile
Stay by my side forever

You're the dream I find
When I close my eyes
Com'on let's get together
You're the reason why
I want praise the sky forever

If you wanna be my queen tonight
If you wanna be my queen of heart
I only want you now
You've got to believe it now
Stay with me tonight

Everyday I try to meet you
But you send me on another time
Everyday same old story

But don't you say goodbye

Burning burning in the fight
Gotta rock you now
Rock you in the night
Makes you feel my love
To hear you say
Say you wanna do it again

It's a mission impossible
It's a mission impossible oh oh
Wanna stay here forever
Lovin' livin' together
But it's a mission impossible
It's a mission impossible oh oh
A mission impossible no no no
Diving into the fire
Of the biggest desire
I live in a movie a mission impossible

Do I have to start to please you?
But I don't wanna loose at all my mind
Play your game with a smile
Pretty lady it's so nice
To kill me with your eyes?

How many times our love was almost dying out
But you were holding on to make it working out

I never believed before you came into my life
'Cause you make it shine so bright
Oh my baby I'll never let you go

I belong to you belong to me
Forever and ever
You belong to me always together
And I wanna sing it

I belong to you belong to me
Forever and ever
You belong to me always together
And I wanna sing it right now
I want the world to know I'm only yours

Wherever I may go in search of something now
A part of me should stay enchained close to you

So, here we are
But it's cold inside our heart
Somebody else in your mind, and you're not mine
Now I know that I'm the one to blame

Just give me one more day
Don't let me stand without you
I'm not so strong

I need a miracle, miracle of love
To make you come, back in my arms
I need a miracle, miracle of love
I'm holding on to the miracle of love

Now it's too late
You don't care to what I say
For all I do to show you, how I want you
There is still the hurt it's all in vain

Precious thing deadly precious thing
you are (I know you are)
Dangerous fall in love is dangerous
(you'll make me cry)

Love is just a game they say
They have never met you babe
I had better run away
Just before you killed all my forces

Poison love poison love
You're going to break my heart
Poison love poison love
Please let me down

Poison love poison love
You're sinking in my heart
Poison love poison love
Tonite

Wonderful playing with the fire is (so
wonderful)
Miracle fall in love with you is like (a
miracle)

Starry darkness all around me
Grass is smelling good
All alone (I) don't feel so lonely
Cricket keep on cry

Universe is over me
And I feel the love and I love to feel
The happiness invasion flows
Cause I know the deal
Cause I've got the keys

"Tonight my heart" tonight is on fire
Get up get up no time to sleep
"Tonight my heart" my heart is on fire
Ready to receive the human being

Warmn the weather, cool my drinkin'
Song goes in my phones

Just in front I see the mountains
Seem to dance with me

I won't belong to this guy only for
Having some fun with him
I felt alone well it's not a crime
And I'm not going to blame myself

I checked my heart in order to make sure I won't find any love
So I've decided and I said it
it was a one night love affair

Walk a mile in my shoes
Load the fire of values
Then you'll know the feelings
That I've got tonite
Oh! My friend
Walk a mile in my shoes
Feel the vibe of sex rules
Then you will be able to give your advise not earlier

So take your time
Don't rush it
Look and get ready to critize
It's been a game
And I though I've made it plain and simple for both of us

Can you imagine disgust
When I knew about last night
Boy, attention! Get me over 
You felt crashing the night
When I said to your girl
"Yes, I love you" - Ya, don't care, guy! 

No music over the dark
No gold of filling her life
A trouble to remove once more
One baby only to share
A cause to nerve ourselves
A trouble night to call 

Bad illusion, in my life
Bad illusion
Changing all the wave, oh babe
Bad illusion, give one night
I'm demanding bad illusion 

To my limit, you, stop
Don't arouse my control
Now is over... now is over! 
You're defeating your hate
You delete our past
That I'm blending with my present

Shake me up and down, I wanna live the night
Tell me that you feel the rythm, my babe!

Can you feel the rythm of the crazy nights?
All you need is magical...
Take me higher

Show me all your power
And slow me down just in the fire
Shocking hot desire
I know your limit 'cause you really got it
Like a fool, babe!

Born to be wild in my car
I wanna give you, baby
All the music underground
Born to have fun in my heart
I'm gonna touch your feelings
You can do the best now
Take it to the limit now

If you wanna give me a little crazy night
You can make me happy, lady... I'm crazy!

Walk int othe crazy rythm of the night
All you feel is music now...
Like the fire

Let the night give me a thrill, let it shake me
When the music is playing tonight
I can't live without you, just believe it
You will be my inspiration, all right

Into the action, babe
I'm gonna touch you, get the fire when you move...
Fantastic!
Turn my heart on, babe
Rockin' my passion, rock into my timeline

Dance on the top of the fire
You wanna make me fly
Mad desire in future nights
Dance to the rock of desire
Together all the night
Feel the power of the time

Come and dance to the beat of desire
Give a chance to my heart one more time
If you look for a dream to believe in
Let me change your direction tonight

Para para, like a boom you drive me crazy
Para para, blue dawn is falling
Para para, like a sound around is lazy
Para para, my war is over

In my dancing night
Can you feel my passion, can you feel the energy
In my fighting day
Do you think of me. I wanna say
Listen what I say

Delta force
Come back, do you believe me
Delta force
I will not crash now
Delta force
The winner, let me kiss you

All my passion
Mighty power

Come on, come on baby
Set me free
Come on, make me crazy
Eurobeat

Beautiful desire, babe

Get the dark side into my brain
Let my anger turn into the music
Move your body, don't stop the game
Over the night I keep it to the rhythm

Get the dark side into my brain
Let my anger turn into the music
Move your body, don't stop the game
Take it all night long
Rhythm of desire

Black sky
I'm living in the jungle, baby
Night desire
Like a fire
Bad sky
Don't stop your little magic
Flowing down my body
Take me higher

Don't don't scratch my back
Don't hurt me anymore
Just because you want a new car
I'll get a new one
Because you are my love
Won't you see that I'm on fire

I feel your dreams, baby dancing queen
Ah-ah-ah
Make me touch your body without jealousy
Now put your hands on your fantasy
Come on little babe
Set your body free now

Hi-speed mania! Hi-speed mania!
Show me now the beauty of your golden empire
Speed speed mania, spice up all your love
Looking for my dreams of fire

Don't don't hit me again
Don't make me feel so bad
'Cause you want an all-new speedstar
Your car comes in black
And you complain no more
So you're happy... so you like it

Shake your body to the disco
Move your legs until tomorrow
Queen of dance, you feel my beat

When you rise the look to me, babe
Spin around my head
You take my time, you realize

Oh oh oh oh oh
Follow me and try
With my dirty love I'll make you fly

Knocking out my fever

Moonlight of midnight
It's all up to you

I can't resist without your love
The night is cold, my lady

You are the girl I'm searching for
To feel the heat of the night

Hey! Let my body rock
Let me feel the shock
Every time you want me, my babe

Hey! I don't lose control
When you call me "Doc!"
And you think I will be so crazy

Night of shadows and morning delights
And the silent hot melody lines
You can dance to the beat of your heart
Together we can feel the power of the money

No money! No honey!
Magic love everyday
My honey, spend money
Just believe in my heart

Hey! You can get my love
Out of my control
You, believe in me, oh my babe

Hey! Take my heart and soul
Limit of your love
Get the power, don't be so lazy

Leave the troubles behind your shoulders
Take a look in your heart

Don't believe in the dark, light your fire
Blast your power inside

Magical desire
To go back to the life for good... you, keep in your mind
I can take you higher
I can help you to feel the magic... the magic of life

Never gonna stop the time, babe
You must follow now your heart
Let it lead you into the brightness
Of the fairy tale of life

Never gonna stop the time, babe
'Cause I'll never leave you alone
All my positive sensations
Take you back into my arms

Let your feelings turn into the fire
Of your life, of your heart

Turn the power into good emotions
Loose your positive charm

Open up your eyes
And look inside of me now
In a summer night

And show me, baby

What I am for you
I feel the beat inside me
When you touch my heart

And let me feel it

Can you listen to the music of my feelings?
Let my heartbeat play the rhythm of tonight
We'll be dancing in the middle of the dance floor
To fill up my heart

Rainy days, don't take me down into the darkness
Rainy days, don't take me away from here tonight
Rainy days, I wanna live with you, my sweet dream
Let me stay... beside you, baby

Open up your mind
And try to understand me
In these lonely nights

Please do it, baby

'Cause you want to find
A little place in my life
Just for you and me

I'm a believer

Every night before you go
Stay with me and watch the show
Take me up, shake me up
By the keyboard try me now

Move your mouse along the screen
Make me live a special dream
On the screen like a beam
Let me fly into the cyber love

I'm looking for amusing jokes on the net
Hey! come on baby to the land of cyberspace

When the music is good for singing
I feel fine and my heart is ready
You recall me but I can't listen, now
'Cause your love (is) not enough for me

Wild is the wind and your hand cannot stop
Everything which is flying away
Time is passed and you can't hide
From me all the times
I'm ready, give me your desire

Falling from the sky
I lost the track of time
An image of my life flashes in my eyes
Straining every muscle
For my contact with Fate
I could never dream my life would end now

Cross my heart
Hope not to die now
Fade to black
This time and this moment
I can't breath
Bracing myself now
Impending doom I'm about to die

Frontal Impact
Feel like going nowhere
World is turning upside down on me
Frontal Impact
Silence filling the air
Now I lost completely my control

Frontal Impact
Feel like going nowhere
Cross my fingers and I start to play
Frontal Impact 
Silence filling the air
Seems I'm watching just myself that dies

I just wanna breath
Choking from the feeling
I don't know if I had cross the line now
Dark is everywhere but
I can feel the pain now
I could never want the end of my life

Can't you give me just one more day
Because I'm living in the dark
I can remember last holiday
When I was looking to the stars

Got a long way to go alone
(Then) I finally talked with you
Everytime I think of you
I can feel it's all right
Because I'm loosing my mind watching you
I'm gonna fall in love

See you again and I get lost forever now
I'm looking for the present for you
Don't wanna lose you and I feel that I'm going to be
Your victim of love

Don't you want to get out with me
I wanna see you soon tonight
I can't wait for another day
I'm missing you so much, my love

It's not a secret, what is my dimension
Racing cars, way too fast for the losers

It's not a secret, what is my decision
Racing fast, what it means to be living

Give me the start
I don't have regrets now
To live or die
Is my only question
I can be fast enough to feel the power
I cross the limit
Of the metal insanity

Now's time

Do it or die full metal cars
Master of all inventions
Break it or burn

Do it or die full metal cars
Racing cars toward the sun

My breath is tearing with the dying sun
Racing cars, I can ride on the wind

My breath is tearing, I feel like I'm drunk
Racing fast, hurricane on the wheels

Don't you cry for me
Now I'm with the stars
Up above the sky

Don't you cry for me
Now I'm in the wind
Like a summer storm

Tonight I could be with you my love
As soon as your love will guide me home
Call me from your heart now
And your wish become a dream come true

I am the spirit of the night
And you will never forget the day
When shiny like the sun I saw that gun
That took me away from you

I am the spirit of the night
They say that spirits will always stays
And I'll be close to you 'cos you were mine
And I belong to you

Don't you cry for me
Now I'm in the rain
Up above the sky

Don't you cry for me
Now I'm in the sun
Like a summer day

It is late at night and I am feeling down
So come on radio give me the sound

And a glass of wine won't fill my empty heart
My radio never lets me down

I need of something to distract my mind
Got you stuck into my head
I turn and dream you still are by my side
Listen to my radio

My heart radio
The songs we used to know

My heart radio
The place we used to go

I'm searching for something
To help myself forgetting pain and strife
But I know whatever I could do
I'll wish you by my side
Listen to my radio

Lying in my bed you're stuck into my head
So come on radio give me the sound

And I wonder why you're still inside my mind
My radio never lets me down

Wanna get a lot of your love
I wanna get some gasoline

Wanna be the book of your dream
You read and follow everyday

I'm the one
I'm the man
I'm mad about you

Down down wanna get you
Down down on me

You little beauty queen
What do you want me to do now?
Tell me what it takes to get you

Fire burning in my head
You soak my heart in gasoline
Oh baby
Light a match and consume me
I love your gasoline
I'm in I'm in

Wanna see the range of my powers
Wanna see I'm superman

Wanna get a taste of my love
You need to get it everyday

Far
So many million miles from home
I'm on the run don't know where to go
Who knows where I will be tomorrow night
I don't know who to trust

Girl
Don't tell me that I have to stay
Just let me live the only way
I've already waste too many times

Super super driver
I'm super drive-er
The price that I'm ready to pay

I'm super driver
Super super drive-er
Gonna give a lonely life

Risk
I take the risk but I don't care
Don't need a gun I take other tools
Some day you'll read my story on the news
Better die than rust

I'll die for you
But my anger is fierce
Let it be done
Can't you see that is true
Get the blood run
'Cause my mission is set
I'll wait the sun go down

Hold on me
It's time of fear and dark is danger
The heart of the dragon's lair -
Take my hand
No time for a final prayer
To save us

Waiting for your hero
I'm the one to take you out the danger
I got the power

Waiting for your hero
Walk on the fire
To save and rescue

Waiting for your hero
I'm the light to guide you through the dunngeons
I got the power

Waiting for your hero

But true and righteous

Nowhere to run
'Cause the battle is on
Nowhere to hide
Let the infidels burn
Dream to fulfill
'Cause my mission is set
I want to save the world

Come and get me

Love is a lite
Like a sun into a winter night, it's all right

I heard you calling me last night on the phone

And I won't be crying for you again
You open your eyes and see

Stay a little closer

Sometimes ago
When I was made for moving (made for moving)

You drive alone
All through the night
Still looking for some fever

You got new energy inside

Runaway runaway

Runaway runaway
In a million ways you steal my passion

Runaway runaway

There is a place, so far from here
Full of emotion, magical fear
Come to me
Follow me forever

I know
I can see the right direction

Moonlight sensation
Deep in my heart
Moonlight emotion
Every night

Moonlight sensation
Feeling and fun
Moonlight emotion
Every time

This night is lazy under the moon
My love is crazy
Out of my room
Come to me
Follow me forever

I can see what's happ'ning
They don't have a clue
They'll fall in love and here's the bottom line
Our trio's down to two

The sweet caress of twilight
There's magic everywhere
And with all this romantic atmosphere
Disaster's in the air

Can you feel the love tonight?
The peace, the evening brings
The world, for once, in perfect harmony
With all its living things

So many things to tell her
But how to make her see
The truth about my past? (Impossible!)
She'd turn away from me

He's holding back, he's hiding
But why I can't decide
Why won't he be the king I know he is?
The king I see inside

Can you feel the love tonight?
The peace, the evening brings
The world, for once, in perfect harmony
With all its living things

Can you feel the love tonight?
You needn't look too far
Stealing through the night's uncertainties
Love is where they are

And if he falls in love tonight
It can be assumed
His carefree days with us are history
In short, our pal is doomed

Watching you, watching me
You don't know how you've betrayed me
Can't find myself lost in your lies
I need to trust myself again

Uh uh uh, got to get away
Uh uh uh, there's nothing you can pray
For so long
I've been in love

I want to heal, I want to feel
Coz nothing is real, suicide
Deep in my head, don't be afraid
Erasing your fears, right now

I want to heal, I want to feel
The pain is real, you won't leave me alone
Over the future over the past
Wasting my time, right now

I am a box I am a screen
I'm every nightmare every dream
I am the window over your land
So turn me on and take my hand

Life is a crazy fire full of feelings full of lonely pain
Looking for a new dimension,
looking for another love

When the music comes to me, is like a special time
The round is started and I'm ready for a fight

Pride
Power and fashion
Ready for a passion
Love and satisfaction
Pride
Take me forever
Shock me now and ever
Give me sex and rock and roll

Pride
Power and fashion
Logical connection
Nasty reputation
Pride

Deep inside my rocky heart

I can show you the world
Shining, shimmering, splendid
Tell me, princess, now
When did you last let your heart decide?

I can open your eyes
Take you wonder by wonder
Over, sideways and under
On a magic carpet ride

A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
No-one to tell us "no!" or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming

A whole new world
A dazzling place I never knew
But now for way up here
It's crystal clear
That now I'm in a whole new world with you

Unbelievable sights
Indescribable feeling
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
Through an endless diamond sky

A whole new world (don't you dare close your eyes)
A hundred thousand things to see (hold your breath, it gets better)
I'm like a shooting star, I've come so far
I can't go back to where I used to be

A whole new world
With new horizons to pursue
I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you

A whole new world (a whole new world)
A new fantastic point of view
No-one to tell us "no!" or where to go

Yellow shoes and cel phone calls
From L.A. to Manhattan

New steps in the candlelight
Part of the rhythm nation
Those ears are out of sight!

She'll make you take your shoes off
And go dancing in the rain

Saw the sights around times Square
She met the Mets and met the mayour

The whole world just adores her
And her name is Minnie Mouse
They all love that Minnie Mouse

You and me, let's just be honest
We're gonna run, nothing can stop us
Even the night that falls all around us

Soon there will be laughter and voices
Beyond the clouds over the mountains
We'll run away on roads that are empty
Lights from the airfield shining upon you

Nothing can stop this, not now I love you
They're not gonna get us
They're not gonna get us
Nothing can stop this, not now I love you
They're not gonna get us

We'll run away, keep everything simple
Night will come down, our guardian angel
We rush ahead, the crossroads are empty
Our spirits rise, they're not gonna get us

My love for you, always forever
Just you and me, all else is nothing
Not going back, not going back there
They don't understand
They don't understand us

Not gonna get us
Not gonna get us

You and I, thinking of all the times we spent together. 
Everyday seemed to me, 
I like a walking dream, a picture of perfection 
But gradually, as time goes by, seems your love lost its lustre. 
With your eyes full of doubt, your suspicions aroused, your voices so full of tension. 
Recently you're been pouting, accusing me of unkindness. 
Tell me, how could you believe 
I would ever hurt you so please listen to what I say 

I will protect you, don't you forget it, your love means the world to me girl. 
You are my angel, nothing will change that, your love is what keeps me strong girl. 
Love is forever, time is a healer, let's welcome the joy to come, girl. 
Deeper & deeper, sweeter & sweeter, together we'll build a future that lasts. 

Losing sight of the precious things that made us special. 
Pretty quarrels all day, see our temper are frayed, rejection & depression. 
Clever words and conversation won't save us from this heartache. 
There's a far better way of expressing ourselves, I'll hold you oh so tightly. 
We're both been playing games, let's give this fighting a rest now. 
Turn our backs on the past, we'll forget all the pain, the good times are here to stay.

Boys & Girls are you ready

We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky & Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

Dance, nobody dance
I'm gonna try to do my best
To spice your fantasy
I'll make your dream to reality

"Sentimento"
We believe in miracles
I just wanna love you my world

come into my skylight
Into the space
Till the new day
Searching new horizons
Skylight
Just a miracle of flowers

Come into my skylight
Into the space
Floating away
Searching new horizons
Skylight
It's a miracle of flowers
Tonight

Dance, baby let's dance
Above you, stars and lights
Surrounding all your fantasy
You better take one more chance with me

Everynight you light me with your
gasoline
Everytime I feel delight when you
recall my name

So you can be my shining star tonite
I'm not alone with all your love
Fly across the sky, you will be mine
Like a real dream with you, babe

Gonna get you like a space boy
I'm ready babe
Gonna catch you I'm your space boy
Dive it to your heart baby
Gonna get you like a space boy

I'll give you my love
Gonna catch you I'm your space boy
Take a chance with me baby

Everynight you drive me crazy as you
know
Everyday I scream so loud: you'll
always be my queen

Baby let me know
Can you set your mind tonight
On gettin' to my planet
Around the universe, honey

White light, tonight
I just wanna see you in action
Come on now it's your time to fly
One more landing

Gonna meet you like a space invader
You must believe in what you'll see, now
Space invader
Super hero, come into the night

Gonna meet you like a space invader
You've got a chance to fly with me now
Space invader
I can see you right into the sky

I can see your face
In the night it seems so cool
Lookin' into my eyes
You're ready to take me, honey

I wait for my time
And look for my girl
If you don't believe me please don't go

It's easy for you
To take me away
We're ready together

I'm ready to go
I'm ready for you
Just waiting the time, please let me know

You have to believe
And never be sad
I'm gonna love you forever

Softly tread the sand below your feet now
Two worlds, one family
Trust your heart
Let fate decide
To guide these lives we see

Beneath the shelter of the trees
Only love can enter here
A simple life, they live in peace

Raise your head up
Lift high the load
Take strength from those that need you
Build high the walls
Build strong the beams
A new life is waiting
But danger’s no stranger here

No words describe a mother’s tears
No words can heal a broken heart
A dream is gone, but where there’s hope

Somewhere something is calling for you
Two worlds, one family
Trust your heart
Let fate decide
To guide these lives we see

Voices arise that one day I might get over

Looking inside, no understanding
Only time will save my music
Feeling my times, I know the reasons
Paradise can't last as a life time

My game is just playing in the night
I need protection major election
My shame is to be forever wild
Changing affections
Bad reputation

Flight into the rising sun
Faces, smiling everyone

I feel it in my heart

My woman from Tokyo
She makes me see
My woman from Tokyo

That carries me away...

My woman from Tokyo
She makes me see
My woman from Tokyo
She's so good to me

But I'm at home and I, I just don't belong...

So far away from the garden you love
She is what moves in the solar, the dove
Soon I shall see just how blank was my mind
When we're alone in the city of mind

Rising from the neon gloom
Shining like a crazy moon
Yeah! she turns me on like a fire owl
I get high !!!

My woman from Tokyo
She makes me see
My woman from Tokyo
She's so good to me

Come, stop your crying, it will be all right 
Just take my hand, hold it tight 
I will protect you from, all around you 
I will be here, don't you cry 

For one so small, you seem so strong 
My arms will hold you, keep you safe and warm 
This bond between us, can't be broken 
I will be here, don't you cry

YES, you'll be in my heart 
From this day on, now and forever more 

You'll be in my heart 
No matter what they say 
You'll be here in my heart, always 

Why can't they understand the way we feel? 
They just don't trust, what they can't explain 
I know we're different but, deep inside us 
We're not that different at all 

Don't listen to them, 'cause what do they know? 
We need each other, to have, to hold 
They'll see in time, I know 
When destiny calls you, you must be strong 
I may not be with you, but you've got to hold on 
They'll see in time, I know, we'll show them together

You might think that I won't make it, on my own

Now it's nothing but my way
'Cause I'm ready to go
And my future is today
You belong to yesterday

'Cause now I'm stronger
There's nothing that you can do
Or that you can say to me
Sometimes I wonder
If I need to love somebody
Or better off alone

'Cause now I'm stronger
There's nothing that I will let you say
Just to stop me now
Sometimes I wonder
I don't need anybody better alone
And on my own

Hush

I didn't really care much of me
You might think that I can't take it, but you're wrong

Young lions go
We're runnin' wild and so free
Out of control
Lost in a dream

Rage in the night
'Cause we just do what we feel
Ready to fight
For victory

We got nothin' left to lose
Do or die, you've got to choose
Just forget the world to
Set the night on fire

Heroes tonight
We've got the power
But nothing lasts forever
Heroes tonight
Your lips on fire
Take my breath away

Heroes tonight
Could last forever
And nothing else can matter
Heroes tonight
The breath of lovers
Blows the night away

Can't turn around

The city lights
Flash on the steel of your soul

A sweet emotion keep us free into the heart

Another day, another way
It's hard to say I need you
Bring me into your life
A question of love, get me so wild

Drivin' like the devil all the way down to Tokio
My body burnin', my heart like a YO-YO
Saw this little manga baby looking so trend
My sexy diva sweet like a candy

I just wanna
Suck the honey
From her lips
Drown in her kisses
Come on baby
Drive me crazy
You make me feel so hot
Gimme your lovin

Sexy diva, little sexy diva

Sexy diva, little sexy diva

Sexy diva, little sexy diva
I feel the fever burnin' inside
Sexy diva, little sexy diva
Baby all I crave is make her mine
Crazy little Venus, can't resist the temptation
I touch her body in my imagination
Sexy baby, she's the mighty queen of the night life
A flesh of velvet kiss'd by the moonlight

I'm running down around this loneliness
My life is movin' with no time

Take my love can you hear me now
Let me know if you can relight my fire
A sweet emotion make me wild
Forever run away, fly away

A flash in the night
Believe me, we can dream any choice of life together
Stay with me in this lovely paradise

Love me like
A flash in the night
Remember, you can make any illusion, life's forever
Take me high and hold me tight all night long
A flash in the night !!

I'm turnin'on around this special night
My heart is groovin' for your love

It's a black cloudy night around me
I am lonely on my way
Let me stay without love and hate now
For just another day

It's a reason to fly away
I don't wanna be in your stupid game
Do you know my name?
Just a moment for lose my mind
And I will be ok

Bad love, bad love
Can you remember when I said to you
That you are a lier?

Bad love, bad love
Don't let me feel so down
I'm too crazy
Gooooo!!!!

Bad love, bad love
Can you forget my heart so fast?
Just a memory of my desire

Bad love, bad love
I really wanna that
You go away from me! Yeah!!

Tell me now
If your dream is over
Leave it now in a hermetic folder
In my mind and in my eyes
Forever you
It's only an illusion

I, i'm ready to move around the world
Let me remember who you are

Bring me into your life
Let me die through your arms
Don't let me fly across the universe
(Don't break my heart again)

Bring me into your life
Stay together all night long
All we need is love love love love...

Tell me now
The time is over
Look at me, look at you now
Two lovers
In my mind and in my life
Forever you
I'm just in confusion

Living under pressure
This life is right for someone else
Dreaming of a new world
I wanna find a way to show myself

I don't know what is right for me
I don't have faight to believe
Running around like a crazy man with no name
(I'm really crazy)

Maybe an injection
I feel a power in my veins
Shambles in the action
In my head I've got a thousand why
It's so strange but I'm afraid
Of myself who is not the same
I'm running around like a crazy, don't ask me why!
I wanna be alone

It's all right
But you don't know my life, it's like the night
It should be an easy thing to satisfy
If we can be so crazy
I wanna show you that...

It's all right
But we have a little time in paradise
To feel more free and satisfied
Will be forever crazy

Come into my dream now
Follow me in this big big state of mind
Livin' on a fiction
Not every woman can live with me

I can't remember where i looked at you
Today is gone tomorrow will be another day

But you can get a satisfaction
With my love and passion

The music plays so loud now

Look at me now
I cannot change my life for you
Because I don't believe in you

You saw me standing by the wall
Corner of a main street
And the lights are flashing on your window sill

And you wanted to dance, so I asked you to dance
But fear is in your soul
Some people call it a one night stand
But we can call it paradise

Don't say a prayer for me now
Save it till the morning after
No don't say a prayer for me now
Don't say a prayer for me now
Save it till the morning after
No don't say a prayer for me now
Save it till the morning after

Pretty looking road I try to hold
The rising floods that fill my skin
Don't ask me why I'll keep my promise I'll melt the ice

And you wanted to dance, so I asked you to dance
But fear is in your soul
Some people call it a one night stand
But we can call it paradise

I, i wanna fly away
For just another day
Don't wait me now

Dive into my heart, and you get into my love
You are the one, you are the one who makes me feel I can thrive

Moon glows like a white headlight
As I walk down the street on my own
Whispers from some other world
Lead me to the way to get to your place

I just spent the last ten days
Thinking of you, being on my own
I can feel your pulse beat strong
Now I need to talk to you face to face

Just answer me, I'm going to look for you.
You are the only one who makes me feel so real

Sitting in the emptiness
I realize that I need you so much
I've been sleeping in the dark
I want you to wake me up with your touch

You call me baby, tell me lady what you mean to do
I wouldn't mess with anybody, I don't think you knew
I can't deny we're having fun, will you be the one
That I've been looking for all along?

You give me crazy fits of longing, now, that's what I like
I need somebody, sexy lady, not just for tonight
You should be making up your mind, don't be so unkind
And now it's time for you to realize

If we need each other every day
I'm gonna have you say
Why don't we start playing it over again?
Tonight's the night

Start
I'll take you high for a start
You're rapped around my heart
And promise not to leave for a start
I just need you for a start
For a start

So won't you come and feel the power of this magic touch
Who could believe this little lady would mean so much
Tonight I feel like raving mad, life was such a drag
Before you let me feel what it's for

And no I've lost all my defences but I just don't care
No need to put up false pretences, you're still all I crave
Don't leave me knocking on my door, don't you leave me sore
Because it's time for me to drag you on

In the middle of a crowd at the station, there you were
You came out of nowhere
Dark-eyed stranger headin' somewhere I'd never been before
I wanted to go there

Now my senses are all unravelin'
Dreamin' of travelin' next to you
I don't even know who you are
But there's no place too far to pursue

Dark-eyed traveler, you're fillin' my dreams
Every night I run away with you
Dark-eyed traveler, I go to extremes
Just to imagine I'm cruisin' with you

Watched you gettin' on a train goin' to some secret place
Did you feel me staring?
I just couldn't turn away, I just had to see your face
I was feelin' daring

You say that you really love me
I'm always on your mind
And you say that I should be your lover
And we should spend some time
Well I'm not persuaded that quickly
My heart has been broken before, you see
So if you want to be my lover
You'll have to prove your love is true to me

'Cause it's easy
To tell me you love me
Easy to say
You're thinkin' of me
Words are so easy to say

Show me, show me you really love me
Actions speak louder than words
Show me, show me you really need me
'Cause all those lies I've already heard
Show me, show me you really love me
Let me believe that it's true
Show me, show me you really need me
Now I'll get together with you

You say that there is no other
I am the only one
And you say that if we were lovers
We would have so much fun
But my mother warned me
That I should beware of young boys
Saying things like you say
So I must be sure that if I give you my love
You won't take it and then run away

All my days are a run for freedom
This is the rhythm of my life
Time after time

Don't need to give a reason why it's only
Me myself and I
Need no uniform, no thought control
I'm hungry like the wold

Baby this is my rebel heart
Forever wild, forever like the wind
In my soul I'm a lonely man

Forever like a rolling stone

People say I'm a crazy guy

Every time we'll stay together well ('cos I need you baby)
Everywhere strawberry fields come true (it's only illusion)
A new fantastic dream, you feel so good (see the show now)

You see me watching at my door
You find me screaming from my soul
You're all I've got to live for, I belong to you

You leave me staring at the phone
I'm waiting for someone to call
But every night you keep on playing with my mind

I try so hard to make you happy, don't you see
For I know that everything I am is because I love

She's my baby, forever is my baby
And I know she will make smile, feel so fine
Living every beat of life
She's my baby, forever is my baby
And I will keep on loving you, holding you
Nothing gonna change

My body's aching all day long
I wonder how to carry on
I'm feeling in despair, I try to understand

What is the reason for this pain
I wanna keep it off my brain
'Cause every time you keep on playing with my heart

My love is surrender
You're the master of my life

But i guess its not too late for me to stay to give us another try

Many heroes gone by
Reappear for crashing in my heart

In that world a planet-fighter
Like a knight
Made me wonder beating the enemy

Let me free through an illusion
How many lies but I don't know why
Tell me the reason, get me in a prison

Like a fire you shine my day
Let the sadness go and fade away
A sweet emotion stop the time
And everything will be so fine

You
Show me the dark side of your moon
There is no secret, baby!
Love is up forever in the wind
You feel me crazy

Looking for a place to fuel my own
Do you remind, I say no?
It's so easy, won't forgive your love

We make love all night, all day
My diamond precious, I come on
In the love of danger, as a stranger
Creep into my body

I feel good, I feel good
Hot love can be enough forever
I feel good, paint it blue
Meet the corner of my soul
I feel good, I feel good
Take my days so high forever
I feel good, make it blue
Take my dreams all night
Whatever, ever!

In the dark
I happened to be on old ship
Terrify
I cry "full of ghosts!"
Then I make out
A signal drew against me
But my mouth is now paralysed

A carillon of the terror
Start(s) to bang'n awful singing, nee-ruh-yeeh
The dark around me, the creaks
Are driving me to depression,
You relight

"MAYDAY", hear me, "MAYDAY"!
It's my S.O.S.
Out with it, guy, discover
"MAYDAY", hear me, "MAYDAY"!
You're my S.O.S.
Where I can hide myself tonight

Tell me why
I'm trembling, baby stop me
Hold me tight
The fear's coming through
Clean up my mind
The night were scaring over
Limit, then
I'm turning to you

Come on and go to the rhythm
Two by two
I wanna leave all my depression all at once
Into the mood

Keep on moving on the moon
I really feel a satisfaction
When I've fun with you

Look in the night where you want
I will be now in everywhere
Just to give my passion
Over your mind I see you
In every time you're something new
When I dream of you

Money gets funny
Ehy, you take me to the top
Money gets funny
Baby, go! Baby, go!
Money gets funny
I will be too mythical
Rock into my body, baby go!

Into the blue you and me
Go down too soon
I'm gonna give you my affection in my dreams
And then I do

What you tell me, I will be good
I'll go to feel a big attraction
In my heart you are

Flying through the sky
And runnin' over the night
Yo supahero!
Get me in the fight my renegade
Fire is burning in the dark
Running in the park
The knight is out of control, you step the tower
Get the city with your power now
Falling with my bad desire

Fighting in the city
Ready tonight!
You are the best one
I hear the power
Feel deep inside!
Smash down your gun and
You are the one for
Ahy ahy ahy ahy!!!

Operation Casablanca
Right in the way I'm feeling hot hot
Boom boom fire, mad desire
Get your power out of control
Operation Casablanca
Everyday I'm getting hot hot
Mad desire, Boom boom power
When you kiss me thru the fire

Gonna scream it loud
My breath is out of control and turning louder
Don't you get my heart with you tonight
Follow with my bad desire

Tonight the rhythm is burning
The music is so funny
We move and dance it
Another night
Another crazy sexy fever
Don't stop the party

We feel like dancing power and action
We feel like moving with satisfaction
C'mon and go and turn me around and around
Tonight I'm special for you
Tonight my love is thrue

Stand up

Tonight the people is moving
We are jumping up and grooving
We play the disco
Another night
Another crazy sexy fever
Don't stop the rhythm

Walkin' up along my way
I think I won't be able to
Feel any feeling inside
But no can close my heart
To every wonder of love
To every wonder of world

Yes I want to live a wonderful life with you
All I want is to be happy with dreams come true
Tell me why you don't believe it's so easy
Tell me how can this be wrong or right

In the land of banana fishes
Let the fantasy run around your mind tonight
Yellow, green and white rain
Call the people in this magic world

On my face a light appears
For bringing you what I've got
A smiling feeling inside
You don't cry and look the sky
and let the stars catch your heart
don’t let your soul be too hard

9 to 5 and I'm all right but now I need some fun. I need it!
Go! Please go train! Please go faster get me out of here

As soon as I get home my life is up
As soon as I get on it's a new start
I wanna be all right and all dressed up
I'm gonna rock the night

Walking alone, I'm on my way coming home
And counting 1.2.3.4. Fire!
Ready to live, tonight I'm going to breathe
I just can't wait for squealing tires

1.2.3.4. and I'll be there, by the front door I will enter
I feel better, I get closer to my new begin

Call me do it now, I'll be yours tonite
Want me to do it right, I won't waste your time
If you pay my fee I will fix it all
Don't need to go deep, I will vanish out

You don't need to fight and you don't need to roar
Cool it down and be quiet
I'm the no plate van and I'm the no trace man
Bring me on!

Wilder faster louder, one and two
I feel like a rider, call me do!
I can be the careless, restless toy for everyone! Woh!

Rent me tonight, I'll be there for sure
Get me by your side, better than your crue
Ask for more this time, no repent at all
Best for money drop, waiting for your call

In the dark night, on the wild side
Hey! Hey! Para Para Hey! Hey! Para Para
Like a rumble, in the jungle
Hey! Hey! Para Para Hey! Hey! Para Para

Better finish my work to get done,
Better pick up my stuff and move on
I just can't wait to put my headphones on
Flying high

Loving Eurobeat, loving Eurobeat
It's a life on fire
Moving to the move, moving to the groove
And I feel alive

By the sea shore, by the dance floor
Hey! Hey! Para Para Hey! Hey! Para Para
From the deejay, from the blue sky
Hey! Hey! Para Para Hey! Hey! Para Para

Wheelpower on the fast lane,
Wheelpower's by my side tonight

Other pilots are behind me,

Wheelpower and go!
Squeal tires come on!

We make it for love, we want it all
Never stop and never surrender!

High decibels in my ears,
My engine's screaing very loud
The stars as my spectators enjoy the race tonight

It is before me, it is before you
There is no way out
I can't even breathe, we don't need to split
It's a silent shout

In a minute we die if it goes with a bite
And there's no move we can do faster
I can't make up my mind, please stop gazing at it!
Listen to what i have to tell ya:

Big Bang! It's a hook!
Hey man! never look
In the eyes of a tiger!
Ok if you stay all night up and pray, if you are still alive.

Liek a bomber, beating stronger music passes by
No more limits, no more greetings,
No more time to die

It's got me swayin'
Not the music that they're playin'
The way your movin' no delusion you're betrayin'
You're lookin' wild
Bein' shy is not your style
No mystery you're callin' me is what you're sayin'

(Not a) moment too soon
This is my desire when I come to you
That you're comin' to me

I'm burnin' up with the passion
And I need a distraction
Wild love take me higher
Cause I'm a slave to the fashion
Give me some of your action girl

My head is spinin'
And the air around me thinin'
I never felt before the way I'm feelin' now
The things you're saying
It's a game you think you're playing
Just don't do anything you think could bring me down

Don't be afraid 'cause the night remembers all

Life is short we got to take the best
really fast

You've got to leave behind all the
troubles and the pain
Set you free let it be
And don't mind to that kind of
depressing people

No matter what they say
Feeling fine and the sound of music
will turn you up
Until tomorrow

wants bring you down
Get this call try to take it all
Only you can be the king and queen
of this town

Something wrong with you today
Something wrong into your eyes
I see things in different ways
'Cause we're living on the edge

Crazy, crazy, it'll never be the same
This kind of love
Maybe, maybe, I am the one to blame

Tonight, tonight, you can't deny it again
I'm right, I'm right, somebody else's on your mind
Tonight, tonight, you are the reason I live
Or I did I just wanna break down and cry

Something wrong with you today
Everybody knows it's wrong
Your love turned me to a slave
And we're living on the edge

Now or never
Time, the time is up for us
It's over
Forever in my heart

It's better gather your stuff
And don't make it touch
'Cause our life is starting over
I won't let you say that I gave up on you
I've been holding on it too

It's my to go!
Maybe then I'll let you know
No more promises of gold
Just to buy my loving

Go!
Come on honey please now go!
Maybe I will stay alone
No more promises of gold
So good-bye my baby

Gone forever
Now, the time is right for me
It's better
To live my life, be free

Hey!! If you think that I do not know
About the little tricks you played with me

You killed everything in me

Burning like a flame into my heart
Burning like a flame into my body
I know you've deceived me and this time

No one ever gets as deep inside you
No one can love me the way you love me 
This is the way I've been longing to be

Eternity - anytime I need to see your face
Is you and me - into your eyes I can see all the rest of my days

Our love is a bed of nails

I know it's hard and sometime you can fail
But it's the beauty of love that can cause a reaction

Push me, squeeze me
Don't forget to kiss me
You treat me badly like a doll
Hit me, shake me
Don't forget to break me
And leave me lonely in my home

I believed in all the things you said
But now it seems to me so unbelievable

Promises, a tender kiss
Now I'm counting all the things I missed
After all you told me, yes you sold me
But they're all just lies

Everytime you

Play my love - always bring it down
Spin my heart - spin it like a top
Break my heart in two

Everytime you

Spin my heart - turn it all around
Play my love - always tear it down
Spin my heart - you don't wanna stop
Break my heart in two

Everytime I close my eyes
I can feel your words so deep inside
And everything it seems to me ridicolous

Sitting in my room I read your letter
Only you can make my life get better

He takes your soul just from the start
He's the master and you're the slave now

There are people around thet we know
Looking us in the eyes, stabbing us in the back...

Before they start to swing the blade... be' be'!!!

They'll take you by surprise, stabbing you right...

Your dream come true

The seaweed is always greener
In somebody else's lake
You dream about going up there
But that is a big mistake
Just look at the world around you
Right here on the ocean floor
Such wonderful things surround you
What more is you lookin' for?

Under the sea
Under the sea
Darling it's better
Down where it's wetter
Take it from me
Up on the shore they work all day
Out in the sun they slave away
While we devotin'
Full time to floatin'
Under the sea

Down here all the fish is happy
As off through the waves they roll
The fish on the land ain't happy
They sad 'cause they in their bowl
But fish in the bowl is lucky
They in for a worser fate
One day when the boss get hungry
Guess who's gon' be on the plate

Under the sea

Nobody beat us
Fry us and eat us
In fricassee
We what the land folks loves to cook
Under the sea we off the hook
We got no troubles
Life is the bubbles

They get the urge 'n' start to play
We got the spirit
You got to hear it
Under the sea

The newt play the flute
The carp play the harp
The plaice play the bass
And they soundin' sharp
The bass play the brass
The chub play the tub
The fluke is the duke of soul
(Yeah)
The ray he can play
The lings on the strings
The trout rockin' out
The blackfish she sings
The smelt and the sprat
They know where it's at
An' oh that blowfish blow

Under the sea
Under the sea
When the sardine
Begin the beguine
It's music to me
What do they got? A lot of sand
We got a hot crustacean band
Each little clam here

Under the sea
Each little slug here
Cuttin' a rug here
Under the sea
Each little snail here
Know how to wail here
That's why it's hotter
Under the water
Ya we in luck here
Down in the muck here
Under the sea

And turn away with my fire

Highway to the Danger Zone
I'll take you
Right into the Danger Zone

You'll never say hello to you
Until you get it on the red line overload
You'll never know what you can do
Until you get it up as high as you can go

Out along the edges
Always where I burn to be
The further on the edge
The hotter the intensity

Highway to the Danger Zone
Gonna take you
Right into the Danger Zone

Highway to the Danger Zone

Crushin' on you babe
Reachin' too close to the burnin' light

Vida, esto es la vida.

Cuando el perro muerde
al que tiene miedo
Hay que ver el mundo

Que me cuentas, que me dices

Un momento, un recuerdo

Walking on my way, need my legs to
lay, working all the day
I go taking no chances to find the
love
And no chances to leave my evil way

What a life is my life
I have no men to say and no game to
play
I need to
Stop the time and take my time
Don't wanna rush my life again

Too fast for love - Too fast for love
Are my days from nine to five
Too fast for love - Too fast for anything
I wanna run and feel alive

Standing all alone, loneliness is strong,
looking at the phone
Waiting for anybody on through the
night
Anyone who hold me so tight tonight.

Don't tell me stories, don't tell me your lies
Too many days of my life
I cried for a love that to me you denied
I cried for a man and now I wonder why

Don't change your mind, don't come back anymore
Too many pieces of heart
I put them together you tore them apart
I kept them together you tore them apart

Million of nights in this pain
I wanted to die
But your coming here has opened my eyes
I will live and learn to fly

I'm too young to die... (to die)... too young to die
I want to stay alive... (tonite)... I'll stay alive
I'm too young to die... (to die)... too young to die for you baby

I'm too young to die... (to die)... too young to die
I want to survive... (tonite)... I will survive
I'm too young to die... (to die)... too young to die for you tonite

Don't tell me stories, don't tell me your lies
Too many days of my life
I cried for a love I don't care anymore
I cried for a man I thought I could die for

Lay on me your body tonight
Anything doesn't get me exciting bride

Lay on me your body to say
Body language and talking with my heart

Love me night and day
Love me so much, my honey
And the dark
Never will be so dark
Night and day
Baby, love me till morning
Hug me tight
Hug me in your arms

BABY, KISS ME ALL NIGHT, all day and over
And never get you down
BABY, KISS ME ALL NIGHT, all day forever
And you fill, I feel you mine
BABY, KISS ME ALL NIGHT, all day and over
And we shake the love tonight
BABY, KISS ME ALL NIGHT, all day forever
Never change again your way

Lay on me the heat of your blow
Anything cannot warm me up all night

Lay on me your cheeks, on my own
Never leave, never say to me "good-bye"

Someone I got to keep closer

Someone precious makes your life better
Even when you're deep in trouble

Everytime I star with you it feels so good
On and on I look at you and wonder why...

You're the number one in my lonely nights
Every time you go, I feel over the sky
Let the music play, I feel horny now
You live forever in my dreams

Ever and never

Just in time, night and day
Shake me down without control

Because I'm no angel - angel
Let the music set on fire, yeah - yeah
Because I'm your physical angel
Let me fly into the sky tonight

In your lonely nights I'm the number one
Move into my groove 'cause I'm thinking of you
Like a Jumping Jack flash me up tonight
You live forever in my dreams

Hey, when you shoot a look at me that way
All my pride is melting away
Then you keep me under pressure
So I'm holding back emotion

Killing me alive, your love is burning
We're like the houses on fire
Spellbound, I surrender
Can't you feel my heart going boom boom boom

the dream that you wish will come true

No matter how your heart is grieving

Hey, hey, let me say
You don't have to run away
C'mon, c'mon
Gotta live to play and play
Like a butterfly
Dancing on the flowers up and down, bad girl!
But with is better

I can rock again
I see the flame
Burning in my veins
And we can start tonight, I don't need no control inside

Bad girl, bad girl around the fire
Everyday is (a) power higher
Bad girl, bad girl
I'm ready for your love I feel so
Bad girl, bad girl around the fire
Everyday is (a) power higher
Bad girl, bad girl
I'm ready for your love I feel so high

Hey, hey, let me stay
I will dance it up the night
C'mon, c'mon
Everything will be alright
I will say goodbye
When we see the sun up on the sky, bad girl!
And with you it's better

Tale as old as time
True as it can be
Barely even friends
Than somebody bends
Unexpectedly

Just a little change
Small, to say the least
Both a little scared
Neither one prepared
Beauty and the beast

Ever just the same
Ever a surprise
Ever as before
Ever just as sure
As the sun will arise

Tale as old as time
Tune as old as song
Bittersweet and strange
Finding you can change
Learning you were wrong

Certain as the sun
Rising in the east
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the beast

Hey boy, don't keep me alone
You drive me crazy baby
Shake my body
Hey you just say you'll be mine
I wanna dance my baby
Shake and move it

Now I want you baby
I don't want you lazy
Please me honey
Take my body
Touch me feel me "Sugar"
"Sugar" baby love me
And don't worry
Make me happy

Beat beat freak you are my freak-out
Beat beat come and get me now
Beat beat freak you got me crazy
Beat beat freak's the biggest lover

Beat me and open your eyes
So we can feel the pleasure
I'll be waiting
Freak me, and look in my eyes
I wanna beat freak baby
Keep me shaking

I met my love
When I was just a little woman
When I was looking for my prince in your
Blue eyes

When you were over there
And I was over there I saw your eyes get cold
As ice
When I pick up the phone could be just on your
Call and that's why
I'll be allways

Behind you beyond me
Even if you don't want to love me
Behind you you'll find me
Till the end of time behind you

I don't know what you left this heart
Of mine in trouble
Believe me when I tell you
(I) wanna take my blame

When I shakes hands with you
Or blow me a kiss and that's lucky too

Now as the ladder of life has been strung
You may think a sweep's
On the bottom most rung
Though I spends me time
In the ashes and smoke
In this whole wide world
There's no happier bloke.

You think you own whatever land you land on
The earth is just a dead thing you can claim
But I know ev'ry rock and tree and creature
Has a life, has a spirit, has a name

You think the only people who are people
Are the people who look and think like you
But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger
You'll learn things you never knew you never knew

Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
Or asked the grinning bobcat why he grins?
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?

Come run the hidden pine trails of the forest
Come taste the sun-sweet berries of the earth
Come roll in all the riches all around you
And for once, never wonder what they're worth

The rainstorm and the river are my brothers
The heron and the otter are my friends
And we are all connected to each other
In a circle, of a hoop that never ends

Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
Or let the eagle tell you where he's been
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?

How high does the sycamore grow?
If you cut it down, then you'll never know

And you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
For whether we are white or copper-skinned
We need to sing with all the voices of the mountain
We need to paint with all the colors of the wind
You can own the earth and still
All you'll own is earth until
You can paint with all colors of the wind

Spinnin 'round I wanna let you move!
I really like to feel the groove
Do you want to play the crazy game?
Should you give up... I'd fall down!

Wanna come in and taste your love
Just opent he door and let me follow
You 'cause I feel like hot when you turn me on
I'm ready to go...

Cooking Boy! Chilly boy! Cookin' my love!
Wanna freak out and dance through the night!

Cooking boy! Chilly boy! Cookin' my love!
Wanna break out dive into your heart!
Cooking boy! Silly boy! Cookin' my love!
Gonna feel for a while like shinin'!

Keep on dancing till the morning light
I wanna come and fill the night
Keep on moving to the crazy sound
(I've) got chilli pepper for you!

So look around
It's Saturday night and people
Looking for a place to run
Look to the ground
You have to decide how long
You will be waiting for your time

And every night you'll be never happy,
Come on babe, wake up and open up your eyes
And every night you'll be very happy
If you don't know
Get it on and dance

Domino, Domino Dancing babe
Domino, domino dance tonight
Domino, Domino Dancing babe

The fabulous promised land
That you can't never find at all

You're livin' in out and over,
Every chance to get some fun

Babe (you're) just in time

Into the fire you walk and dance
I open my eyes like in a trance
Many things happen into your world
Nothing for me then I pray the load

No trains to wait for
No rights to fight for
I want you to be my guiding light
And
Let my brain go boom
Come to my bedroom
I need you to be my superman

Get me burnin' up for your love
Let me get it hot to the core
Like a bomb that explodes in my heart
Right baby right fly me to your star

You're on the wild side not to defiance
I'm on the quiet one not in my plans
I have no fear and nothing to loose
I have no tears for those who like rules

I was standing on my own by the telephone
Longing' just to hear your voice again
Boy you make me so confused, and excited too!
Things I'd never thought that I could do

'Cause every time I think of you
I can't control myself
Your love is so emotional
Got me form within

Got me burning hot hot
Babe I'm so hot, hot
I fall in flames
And I just can't stop
Temperature is hot, hot
Rising to the top hot
Can't save the world you're about to shock

If you wanna be with me pleasure's guaranteed
There's no way I'll let you down this time
Got to feel your body heat
Making love is sweet
Boy you'd better fill me up this time

All the promises we made
When we were together now are gone
All the fantasies on us
Seamed to be so real at that time

But now that
Love is over I feel anger
Down deep into my heart
But now that
I remember you're a stranger
I can't recognize my boyfriend

And it's not easy to believe it
It wasn't easy to convince myself
You made it in the name of loving
Oh no babe!

Nothing compares to my affection
Nothing else can destroy my life because
I did it in the name of loving
It's how I did it!

Mine, I thought you were mine babe
'Cause you've showed me your dark side
How could I have been so blind
Not to see you were away from me
But now that

I tried to sort it out, tell you what's all about
'Cause now I need to make a decision
There's something missing here, something that I can feel
I want to stop with this soul division

You, wanted this love to fall apart
I felt the absence of your heart
I got to get out of this desert
And swim the ocean of love

No no baby - I'll never see you again
No no darling - I don't want to talk about you
When I'll wake up tomorrow
I want to start with a brand new day

No no baby - I'll never see you again
No no darling - I don't want to die for you
When I'll wake up tomorrow
I want to know that I'm far away

Nothing that I can do, it's better for you too
To find who can give you love and affection
No matter what I say, you're pushing me away
I can't stand anymore disconnection

Love is so easy
Love is so easy to forget
Come over baby
It's right time now make your bet

Love is not fantasy for you and me
We keep the fire inside
One more time make it right
And stay with me tonight

In your dreams
Let's get together in your dreams
I'm burning hot desire
Feeling the fire inside
See you baby

In your dreams
Let's get together in your dreams
Remember tears in my eyes
Love me again, and again once again before
tomorrow

You think I'm crazy
I don't remember yesterdays
You daze me baby
I need you deeper everyday

You'll turn me up if the world will turn me down
You'll cheer me up if my face will wear a frown
The beat goes on and we'll let it rolling on
And on and on

While the music is on we can dance together
Get away from our lives tonite
I won't get go if the game gets harder
I'll be right by your side yes I will

Living loud yes I'm living loud
I can show you how
We can have fun together

Living loud yes I'm living loud
Baby please don't stop me now
Or ever

You'll light me up if the world is sad and dark
You'll shake me up if I need a kick to start
The beat goes on and you'll never let me down
I know I know

Among this people I feel they want me to live their way of my whole life
Among this people I feel really bed I need to get off
It's the very first impression that is wrongly giving out all those bed news over me
It's only my reaction that is leading me away

On my own - I'm well... and nothing can take me down
'Cause I'm higher than the highest
(I) don't belong to you. I want belong to nobody
Let it be...

Just look around you... Body!!
It's all set up to dominate your mind
I've looked around me honey and be sure they won't get my soul

Mary's most spoken name here
I have no more tears
My only sin, a tractor beam
Is in my pretty face

And for people of my hometown
My life is a playground and it makes me
Wonder why I don't dare to fade with no trace

Gossip's not a crime
But leaves a sign

Down down deep into me
So more than before
I feel to grow
A tiny voice, that goes...

Runaway and never looking back...
... Find a place where you can leave a track
Runaway voices say
Make your deepest wishes come true

They say due to such a beauty
She won't do her duties
And it makes me anger coz' I'm tender
And can be more

Sometimes when I'm thinking of you I feel high
I feel go inside
I feel like I'm sinking in your love that I need tonight

So in you can come and see me baby
I could take you to the stars right now
Just open your mind
I know the I'll find the way into your heart

I'm a smooth operator a cool operator
No hesitation 'cos I need you today
I'm a smooth operator a cool operator
Got the sweetest sensation of love
All the way

I'm a smooth operator a cool operator
With your perfection I really feel free
I'm a smooth operator a cool operator
Got my hand upon your body - I got what you need

And if we make love together feeling right
Feeling good inside
Yes I wanna stay forever now in your arms tonight

Baby used to be the one who loved to keep you on string
But I haven't been the same as you became
The real thing

And when I tell myself you're just a friend
My heart keeps callin' your name
you lead the game, don't no other man
Now I got you under my skin

You're the leader of the game
You're the heart of the flame
My heart goes bang for you an'I feel no shame

You're the leader of the game
You're the fire and the rain

I want the wind to mess my hair

And nothing else I really care
And nothing else I really bare
It's only me and I tonite
It's only me and joy of living

Feelin' alive is an ocean to dive
It's hard to believe and really hard to spell it
It's like a vibe coming up from the core
(It's) ready to kill or ready to be my load

I want to ride my bike and today
I want to ride it as long as I need
Watching the children beside my way
I want to feel their happiness

All this sense of stillness here
Makes your body fall apart
All you're left with is your bed and your desire

And all you need
Is just some kind of movement
Moving 'till the end of this night
Movin' up your body and your mind

I would never say the things I say
I would never cry the tears I cry
And I would never be 'round n' round
the trees of love

It's a love for sale

Every man I met has gone away
Every man I met had to pray
And I will never die
Ride and ride I will survive

Yes I will

I'll give it all. No repent no more
This is my call. Message for the world
I'll give it all. Take it with no fear
It's what I want. Warning from
the heart

Hey people

Don't wanna love anymore hey

Only Jesus feels what I have felt
And only you will buy all the love that I
don't want.

Yes you will.

While my heaven awaits the fever flows into me so deep and
While my passion awaits the lion is in me goes to sleep

And it's like an angel and it's like a whisper whispering in my ears
When it takes me tender when it takes my hand to set me lonely no more
I live my way never loosing faith

That is while my love awaits something into me says "it's not too late" carrying on and singing Ya Ya Yoo
I won't cry for men no more
That is while my love awaits waiting for the time when I'll find a trace leading me to found love Ya Ya Yoo
Until a sign would come to me...
That is while my love awaits

While my tension awaits the wires into me deep are cool and
While my loving awaits in stand by so that I can't go fool

Feeling lonely on the ocean
We're floating on a boat
Do you know that all I want is you? I wrote...

Lights are burning in the lighthouse
A direction, where to go?
North, East, South or West. I think you know

See the light and feel the power

Feel the rhythm of the nightlife
Show the colors of your life
C'mon baby it's a long time
Shake your body

In the morning I wake up start my day
To the rhythm
In the afternoon I walk home from my school
Always to the rhythm

With my party shoes I go
To the rave, I'll dance all night
'Cause my heart has been sold
To the master of the rhythm

I'm a slave to the rhythm
Slave to the kick
Feel my heart is beating after this song
I'm a slave to the rhythm
Slave to the bone
From my feet, to my head
Feel my body is turned on

In the morning I dress up and ride my bike
To the rhythm
In the afternoon you find me working out
Always to the rhythm

Night and day alone, I'm sorry
But I can't control
A wrong decision made before
Try to understand me and please don't leave me

Stay, we can live in paradise
I'll never change the feelings in my life
Together, you and I

I just wanna stay with you
You make me feel my love so true
Shine as a star in the sky
Don't stop the time
We can spend this time together

I just wanna stay with you
Only with you my heart is true
Love is around and around
Just for a while
Me and you will fly forever

Night and day alone, I'm sorry
I was away from you
A sad emotion takes me now
Try to make a breath but please don't leave me

Girl, I don't understand
All the world is in your hand tonight
Life, sometime is so wild
But you know... I'm watin' for you

This is the night of the fire
You can spend your time with me forever
I wanna fly to the limit of the action
Let me go... now or never!

In need of power all night long
Hey, don't say me goodbye
'Cause you know, I'm waitin' for you

Why don't you believe I say why you don't believe
That I love you
After all I have the right to pretend to know whatever
You've got in
And I really wonder
Whu should I achieve I say why I should achieve what I run to
After that you got me started so fast nobody can't stop
The race now
And I do wonder wonder

If you really want to restart the game with me
And explanation of situation is over you and me
Why can't this be love and tell me
Why can't this go on forever
Why can't this be turned to passion
Why you keep on breaking my heart and I wonder

Why can't this be love and tell me
Why can't this be love and affection
Since you know what happened there on the beach
Was more and more than a feeling
And I do wonder wonder

There's a place around me
Gonna takes me out of time
I'll never see the light so white
I'll never see you, face to face

There's a stupid lady
She can't make me understand
I'll never see the light so white
I'll never be so misty and wild

Follow me in this broken night
Let the fever takes me high
So every time you spring your lonely wings
You'll shine like the star

Dead or alive

Don't stop, don't stop your illusion
Don't cry, I have the right solution
Wait me now. I've got a secret plan to be revealed

You know, I'm a star fighter
I'll drive you crazy on the starway
Let you go
In the galaxy of my lonely dream

Don't pray anymore my babe
Nothing you can do... not now
You've done already enough
How many lies? and you don't know why !
Come on go!

This is the end of the world
This is the end of your life
There's a free seat on my spaceship
Baby are you ready to go?

Is this the end of the world?
But we can fight on this storm
A long journey homey, I know I know
This is the end of the world

Don't stop, don't stop your confusion
Don't go away from my conclusion
Love me now
I've got a secret feeling to be real

Speed top down through the city of lights
Keep on movin' like a storm
Easy to do when the night is mine
My god my vette is racing now

Easy to lose it
Must drive faster
Gotta gun it
Gonna stomp it
Nothings gonna slow me down increasing that speed

Can you remember me?

Girl, you could be mine

With the law behind me I keep on pushin that pedal down
No slowing up

Needed soda anyway
Easy to do when the night is mine
My god my vette is racing now

Got to be the first one
Got to be the last one
You never get no peace of mind
Never show emotions
All communication's over you
Got no feeling

Stop me now guess you wonder why
You just sold out the dream inside
Up and down, baby for your lovin'
Baby we can fly up to the sky

Every day, every night crazy for love
Into the depth of desire
Every time, everywhere crazy for love
And now my spirit's on fire

When you get the feeling
When you find some lovin'
You've got to run away from here
Show me your emotion
Baby make me feel so natural
It's the real thing

You can never beat me down down baby
Now we're reachin' to the top
Steppin' out to have some fun- fun honey
Squeeze my heart- squeeze my heart

Tonight I wanna feel higher, so higher- baby

Make me feel tonight you're hot hot baby
Now you know you'll never stop
Hit me with your rhythm tom tom honey
Ask for more - more love

Listen, take another
That's what superheroes drink tonight
Don't you worry, brother
Just forget about it, you get by

When a story dies, ashes get in your eyes
In the black of night you know you always rely on
Deep inside, and then you feel you're still alright

I wanna see you fight and go wild
Gotta kill the pain of a lonely heart
You're gonna dig the feeling, go wild
Stumbled in your soul, they can't stop you now
I wanna see you fight and go wild
Gotta feel it down in your flesh and blood
You're gonna get the feeling, go wild
When the chips are down and the road is dark
I wanna see you dance and go wild
Right on tonight

Brother, can you feel it
Life is what you win or what you lose
Take an easy limit
I can see you lost and so confused

I really need to find a moment in time
A bigger chance to
Tell me who I am
I'm breakin' down and hard, the pressure is high
I'll keep on dancin'
But no romancin'

Another day another feeling for you
A world of fancy
Wild and faraway
Wild and faraway
I want my freedom bay why can't you see
I wanna be
Myself and me
Baby

Ooooooooh - I wanna take a chance
For a moment's passion, babe
Ooooooooh - I wanna fly, the open sky's for me
Ooooooooh - I wanna take a chance
With a cool emotion, babe
Ooooooooh - I wanna see my freedom there for me
I wanna take a chance

An easy life, a tidy love in your arms
And nice embraces
Thake you anyway
I feel a prisoner, oh why can't you see
I'll keep on changin'
I wanna feel ya

Sometime I find a reason to believe
I love you even if you think that I don't
I never let you go away from me
My heart is falling down for you tonight

In the deep of the night we can see the light
We are breaking the time above this blue sky
Please, don't lose your mind!

Wait
Until the day of the rain
C'mon take me now, that's the way!
The magic is in the air tonight, everywhere, baby
Forever we'll be together
Stay
This is the day of the rain
It will be better than yesterday
C'mon, the feeling is high tonight, love me now, baby
Forever we'll fly together

Sometime I need a feeling to believe
I need you even if you think that I don't
I never let you go away from me
My heart is falling down for you tonight

One is in England, one is in Australia
Some other is flying and some is landing somewhere else

We are hundreds all around (the) world
And we are the bad girls gone wild
All united, independents, don't need a man,
'Coz we need 'em in millions!

Looking for lovers in the round world
Searching for someone who's OK
"Always on the loose" is our password
Looking for lovers is what we do

Somebody's ringing some else on the planet
The program was set down to help and to check each other

Babe tell me why your love has gone away,
Iâ€™m so sad
Everything I thought was good has now gone bad
Makes me mad

All my love
That I gave to you was precious
Now youâ€™re gone
All  you've left is memory

Say a little prayer for this broken heart
Say a little prayer for this love of mine
Tonite I feel so cold and lonely
I long for your touch
Say a little prayer for this broken heart
Say a little prayer for this soul of mine
Tonite I feel so cold and lonely
I long for your loving


Iâ€™ve been waiting for your call a thousand nights
Tell me why
Picking up the pieces of my broken heart. Canâ€™t survive.

Never fall in love again
I'm tellin' myself everyday
Owner of a lonely heat
I gave you my time
But not all my life

In your eyes
A secret's come to show
What your mind wishes to hold
So tonight I will let you go, oh no, babe

It's my life
I wanna live without you
It's my life
I have to go, please forgive me

Drivin' in the city lights
Thinkin' of you, when I said goodbye
Such a shame your love is gone
But don't be afraid, you won't be alone

Like a rocket flashin' in the night
Leave a message, baby, now I'm out of sight
Hang on to myself, I'm huntin' for feelin'

A big game
On my mind
I'm clubbin' 'round the midnight
Lookin' for love
Like I'm dance' in the wind tonight

Baby, I'm a midnight lover
Burnin' out your secret desire
Wanna be your midnight lover
Lightin' up the stars with your fire
Baby, I'm a midnight lover
Turnin' on your secret desires
Gotta be your midnight lover
Wake up for the night is fire

An emotion smashin' up my brain
Like a secret longin' drivin' me insane
Just gotta go now, still lookin' for a feelin'

Baby you’re solid gold
Baby you’re solid gold
Shine forever, can’t wait till tomorrow

I want you baby
Maybe tonight I'll take you far away
I see you dancing
Shining like a jewel

Burning for love
In the golden light of love inside
You're my prize, my heaven
You're my precious fire for me

Baby you're solid gold
Reaching out, I don't wanna let you go
Baby you're solid gold
Shine forever, can't wait till tomorrow
Baby you're solid gold
Reaching out, I don't wanna let you go
Baby you're solid gold
Shine forever, can't wait till tomorrow

I need you baby
Crazy for you and all the things I do
Feel like romancing
We were meant forever

I’ll take you far away
Shining like a jewel

Come on baby, you know I'm ready
Blow my mind with your lovin' tonight
Rock me to the top, you dig that feeling
Turn me on, baby never stop!

Shake me all over, say I'm your lover baby
Touching my body free (come close to me)
Act on emotion, a revolution
My heart, feel it baby, you rock, you rock!

Rock me to the top
Come on, come on do it baby
Rock me never stop
Come on, come on baby!
Rock me to the top
Come on, come on pretty baby
Don't stop loving rock, until I die for yor love

Rock me to the top
Come on, come on do it baby
Rock me never stop

Rock me to the top
Come on, come on pretty baby
Don't stop loving rock, to the top!

Baby, baby...  You got me cravin'
Gotta learn, get a freedom tonight
Shock me to the top, this burning feeling
Turns me on, baby never stop!

She's sold my soul to the devil
I feel her fire is raisin' hell
No-one can ever say I'm the same I used to be

Here we go
The lady's creepin' to my heart
Shadow dancin' in the dark
Walkin' in the starlight
Now she's goin' my way

And she's a mystery
She's turnin' up and down all of my history
I cannot resist her mystery
But all her lies just say she's alone alone alone

And she's a mystery
Her love is like a skyway to my destiny
A black leather lady
Mystery
I'll never understand her at all at all at all
I know she's my mystery

She's got an evil desire
I feel so deep and inside of me
No way I'll ever win her powers over me

Running, you're running
No cryin' for love and hungry like a lion
Fighting, go fighting
Searching for heroes into night

No, you wanna let go
I'm looking for a beautiful lover
Oh no, I'm out of control
I wanna feel the power
Higher on your lovin'

Stay the night
Can you help me somebody
Give me your lovening all, everybody
Stay the night
Gotta help me somebody
You've got a message it in your heart, babe

Burning, I'm burning
I'm callin' for love now, set my mind on fire
Baby, don't stop me
Turnin' me off in my head around

Everybody has come to the party
I see you watchin' me, harder and strong
Leave me hangin', you keep me waitin
Just wanna stop you goin' on

I know this feelin'
Lookin' for shelter
You better leave me alone
Take me higher
Drop me from heaven
Look for the right time
To stop & go wild

I don't wanna hear you tell me stop & go
Don't fool me all around
I'll never let you down
Love me for awhile, don't tell stop & go
So baby make up your mind
You stop & go wild

Tell me baby, you or me crazy?
I know you're checkin' me out for so long
Up we're flyin', down we go crashin'
Just wanna stop you goin' on

I wanna feel the way you feel
I know you'll take me up and down
But before you start
I will teach my heart
To be steely

And when I'm feeling lonely
And baby - sorry
I wanna get the feeling to fight for you
And when you shine bright
Your love is real light
And I'll forget the pain just to reach to you

I feel the fire and the rain
The game you play is no escape for me baby
Dance in the fire and the rain
Destiny Child - you can really believe me
I feel the fire and the rain
The game you play is no escape for me baby
Dance in the fire and the rain
Destiny Child - you can really believe me
The fire and the rain

I'm lookin' for a way to be
I'm never gonna let you down
Just in case you find
You can change your mind
And be leavin'

Life is hard every day, every night
I'm feelin' like I live in the frontline
Don't let go, baby stand up and fight
Adrenalin is into my blood

Get up, now
Stand upright
Hold on tight
With anger
Forever
Baby no surrender tonight

The lovebite
Dancin' in the shadow with a dark smile
Never fall in love again with feelings
Stranger in your heart forever callin'-
The lovebite

On the run, lookin' up to the sky
I wanna be alive in the hi-tide
Now don't stop, baby, gotta be right
I'm never gonna give up and die

Baby make me feel good
Like a fire in the night
You blow me out of my mind

You cry for love to take you higher
Take me higher

Don't know why I scream for the love
You make me feel
Baby baby tell me you're the one I want
Got no time to show you the way
You make it real

You make me feel

You're born to drive me wild

Baby you're my angel
Take a moment in time
To spin me into the light

We're burnin' like a house on fire
Take me higher

Come tonight it's party time
Come and see the stars into your eyes
Can't you feel my baby ev'rything's alive now

Ready for the dance all my life
Waiting for the start ready for your heart
Taking up your chance get me to the show
Time to go

So just give a little passion tonite
Isn't just another fashion this time
Maybe all you know is changin' your destiny
So just give a little passion tonite
Let me take you to the party this time
Gonna feel the sun dancing your melody, harmony

When you're smiling ev'rything
Ev'ry moment seems to fly away
When you're feeling passion
All the world is gettin'

(Feel) My body and my soul on fire now
I got to be strong to reach the goal that I need
It's you and no one else
(You) The beautiful love inside me
I know it's so hard the game that we play
Sounds just the same "you live or die"

I won't let you down
Cause I really love the game
Love the game you play
Want you spin me around?
And I'll give you all the changes
Show me now your face

Baby now I'm there I'm ready for your love
And if you care I'm ready for you
Callin' your name I'm ready for your love
Passion and free are the things that I need
Baby I'm there I'm ready for your love
In body and my soul  I'm ready for you
Got to be strong I'm ready for your love
Passion and free are the things that I need

(You) Oh baby don't treat me like a fool
I know that you want me and if you want me
By your side I will be there
(You) Don't ask me your questions of soul
I'm really the man who lose control gonna get
Be mine right out of here

I feel good just standing here
Carried by this melody
Sing me through this special night
Dancing till the monring light

Nothing now can bring me down
Reaching for the perfect sound
Spin my body whirl my soul
Baby ove me till I get out of control

I feel I feel love
Would you believe me
I feel I feel love
Baby don't leave me

Baby now I know we're near
Reaching loving exstasy
Move it time don't go too fast
Make it crazy make it last

Walkin' till the morning
(And) walkin' through the crimes in the streets
I want to get lovin' tonight
I'm lookin' out hot sex to buy

Racin' across the bright light
(I) slam my car so fast to the hill
And radio start beating tonight
Night drives me mad I feel O.K.!

Living by night
Just keeping on the wire
Night by night I'll never be alone
Rock and rollin', looking for fight
And rockin' sexy women left to the right

Black night, people night
You can't never stop me now
I'm screamin' at the moonlight!
Black night, people night
Dancing to the next wake up
I'm lookin' like a bad bad boy

Dicing with the devil
Feel the game that's running too hot
I love it but (it's) getting me down
I need to move and look around

Driving to the night club
Having fun so close to the girls
I know someone's talking to me
That lady dances in front of me

BLACK RAIN keeps on falling down
Falling down on me so fine again
One more I'll be looking back
Searching for your body in the dark

Nobody knows it
No one wants to love me, to love me
Nobody cares it
I'm alone again, alone in the city

BLACK RAIN AH AH
Is falling down on my back and on my fire
BLACK RAIN AH AH
Is coming down to the ground, it's like a river

BLACK RAIN makes me feel so wet
Makes me feel so cold an dirty man
I know you won't come again
(Is) Raining down the tears from my eyes

You and me we feel a little crazy
And how baby now you make me lazy
Not for you I can't give my attention
Love me baby love me but with action

Tell me what to do I'm feeling blue
You mademe deep in love for you
Got to let me go because I need to get into action

I don't believe in your love
You touch my body and you drive me crazy
I don't believe in your love give me a place to go baby

I don't believe in your love
You touch my body and you make me lazy
I don't believe in your love give me a way to go

Believe me when I say you got the power to do it
Love is in your heart, faith is in your mind
Everything you need is already what you're got

Don't talk to STRANGER
Don't talk to anyone
Don't talk but walk and keep on walking
Don't talk to STRANGER
Don't talk to anyone
Don't talk keep out and leave alone

In the middle of the street
Looking for a whisky to drink
There are many rattle snakes
In this creepy night of the long knives

And we're all gonna shine a light together
All shine a light to light a way
Brother's and sister's, in every little part
Let our love shine a light, in every corner of my hearts

Love shine a light, in every corner of my dreams
Let the love light carry, let the love light carry
Like the mighty river, flowing from the stream
Let our love shine a light, in every corner of my dreams

And we're all gonna shine a light together
All shine a light to light a way
Brother's and sister's, in every little part
Let our love shine a light, in every corner of my heart
Shine a light, in every corner of my heart

Let the love light carry, let the love light carry
Light up the magic, for every boy and girl

And we're all gonna shine a light together
All shine a light to light a way
Brother's and sister's, in every little part

Let's make all the tears become a smile

In the morning I rethink about your love
I rethink about the way you made me feel
Oh baby... how did you...

...Made me feel that way?
So that nothing else was there with us and...
...Where did you...
...Get your power from?

So now I beg you

In that bedroom you just got me to the top
And you got me there with you only for run
Oh baby... how did you...

On the radio, on every TV show 
for each and every reason, each and every season
Music when we love for the moon above 
music for the show of life that never ends
Music on a plane, music on a train
sailing on the ocean, music in the motion
Music in your car, at your local bar
There's music when you look at a star

You can't stop the music, nobody can stop the music
Keep your love apart, mend a broken heart
Catch a falling star that's much easier
No, you can't stop the music, nobody can stop the music
Till the sun don't shine, got about the time
'Cause that's easier to do

Movin' with the wind since the world began
the beat is gonna getcha, beat is gonna getcha
Music for the blues, for your dancin' shoes
there's music in the way that we kiss, you can't resist
Movin' through the trees, buzzin' with the bees
the sound is gettin' louder, sound is gettin' louder
Music when we play, when we kneel to pray
There's music in the sound of the wind

You can't stop the music, nobody can stop the music
Take the heat from flame, try not feeling pain
though you try in vain it's much easier
No, you can't stop the music, nobody can stop the music
Change the master plan, take the hope from man 
'Cause that's easier to do

Everyone you meet, the children in the street
There's no place to hide, so, why even try?

Everyone you meet, the children in the street 
are swayin' to the rhythm, there's somethin' movin' in them
There's no place to hide, so, why even try? 
Can't you hear it coming your way, it's here to stay
Music in our walk, music when we talk
It's really something magic, to lose it would be tragic
Can't you feel the sound movin' through the ground? 
Music makes the world go around

You can't stop the music, nobody can stop the music
Take the cold from snow, tell the trees, don't grow
tell the wind, don't blow, 'cause it's easier
No, you can't stop the music, nobody can stop the music
Take the spark from love, make the rain fall up 
'Cause that's easier to do

Sie ritten um die Wette mit dem Steppenwind, tausend Mann.
Und einer ritt voran dem folgten alle blind, Dschingis Khan
Die Hufe ihrer Pferde, die peitschten den Sand, sie trugen Angst und Schrecken
in jedes Land und weder Blitz noch Donner hielt sie auf.

Dsching, Dsching, Dschingis Khan, he Reiter, ho Reiter, he Reiter immer weiter
Dsching, Dsching, Dschingis Khan, he Männer, ho Männer, tanzt Männer so wie immer.
Und man hört sie lachen ho, ho, ho, ho, immer lauter lachen ha, ha, ha, ha, und er leert den Krug in einem Zug.
Dsching, Dsching, Dschingis Khan, he Reiter, ho Reiter, he Reiter immer weiter
Dsching, Dsching, Dschingis Khan, he Männer, ho Männer, tanzt Männer so wie immer.
Und man hört sie lachen ho, ho, ho, ho, immer lauter lachen ha, ha, ha, ha, und der Teufel kriegt und früh genug.

Und jedes Weib das ihm gefiel das nahm er sich in sein Zelt.
Es hieß die Frau die ihn nicht liebte gab es nicht auf der Welt.
Die Hufe ihrer Pferde, die peitschten den Sand, sie trugen Angst und Schrecken
in jedes Land und weder Blitz noch Donner hielt sie auf.

Dsching, Dsching, Dschingis Khan, he Reiter, ho Reiter, he Reiter immer weiter
Dsching, Dsching, Dschingis Khan, he Männer, ho Männer, tanzt Männer so wie immer.
Und man hört sie lachen ho, ho, ho, ho, immer lauter lachen ha, ha, ha, ha, und er leert den Krug in einem Zug.
Dsching, Dsching, Dschingis Khan, he Reiter, ho Reiter, he Reiter immer weiter
Dsching, Dsching, Dschingis Khan, he Männer, ho Männer, tanzt Männer so wie immer.
Und man hört sie lachen ho, ho, ho, ho, immer lauter lachen ha, ha, ha, ha, und der Teufel kriegt und früh genug.

Translation:

They rided in competition with the prairie wind, a thousand men.
And one of them rided in front, all followed him blind, Dschingis Khan
The hooves of their horses, they whipped the sand, they carried fear and loathing
in every country and neither flash nor thunder stopped them.

Dsching, Dsching, Dschingis Khan, he rider, ho rider, he rider more and more
Dsching, Dsching, Dschingis Khan, he men, ho men, dance men as always.
And you hear them laughing ho, ho, ho, ho, louder and louder laughing ha, ha, ha, ha and he emptied the jug in a draft
Dsching, Dsching, Dschingis Khan, he rider, ho rider, he rider more and more
Dsching, Dsching, Dschingis Khan, he men, ho men, dance men as always.
And you hear them laughing ho, ho, ho, louder and louder ha, ha, ha, ha, and the devil gets and soon enough.

And every woman who he liked he tooked her in his tent.
They said the woman who didn't love him doesn't exist in the world.
The hooves of their horses, they whipped the sand, they carried fear and loathing
in every country and neither flash nor thunder stopped them.

Dsching, Dsching, Dschingis Khan, he rider, ho rider, he rider more and more
Dsching, Dsching, Dschingis Khan, he men, ho men, dance men as always.
And you hear them laughing ho, ho, ho, ho, louder and louder laughing ha, ha, ha, ha and he emptied the jug in a draft
Dsching, Dsching, Dschingis Khan, he rider, ho rider, he rider more and more
Dsching, Dsching, Dschingis Khan, he men, ho men, dance men as always.
And you hear them laughing ho, ho, ho, louder and louder ha, ha, ha, ha, and the devil gets and soon enough.

I'm living in a silent room
Waiting no more for your telephone calls
The light is slowly fading inside my eyes

I'm thinking of my old mistakes
The years I've lost pointed on my face
I'm looking for place to hide my fears

Another silent day is over again
Every word you said put me in the air

I don't need your love
Please leave me alone
I can stand you no more
You'll never change your mind
You make me feel blind
I don't need you anymore

It's raining deep inside my soul
Hands are shaking in the winter's cold
The wind is blowing high in the city streets

I need a place to share only with you
You want to take my heart just to give it away

Cross the border
To the New Mexico
You shot the sheriff
Boom boom boom boom
Ride a Mustang
Back to San Diego
With your pocket full of dollars

Oklahoma, Arizona
Burning sand and thirst of water
Colorado no Eldorado
Many ranger dogs all around

Dr. Wesson and Mr. Smith
Hey!
Only the devil knows who are you
Dr. Wesson and Mr. Smith
Hey!
There is a bullet
Your name is on it

Bad boy gunner
You are the number one
To my six-shooter
Bang bang bang bang
In Santiago you desperado
Down the canyon
Full of rangers

Sometimes in this world
Nothing's going the way we want
I'm here on my own
Between my bedroom walls
The windows are closed
Winter's blowing on the road
You are so far away
I wish you were here today

I'll never forget the things you told me last time
The things you told me there
I want to collect those memories inside my head

It's your time
Free your mind
There's a place somewhere, you will find me there
It's my time
You'll be mine
I'll be there to give you all the love you need

There's something to do
Destiny can't be so cruel
I'll never give up
Let me come inside your heart
I'm writing some words
To show you that you are my world
You are deep inside my mind
The only thing I need is your love

I'll never forget the things you told me last time
The things you told me there
I want to collect those memories inside my head

It's your time
Free your mind
There's a place somewhere, you will find me there
It's my time
You'll be mine
I'll be there to give you all the love you need

You, shining like a falling star along my way
Walking in the streets of Paris
I, looking through the city lights, love's like a game
I've never felt so lost in Paris.

I've seen your face everywhere
Coming out of nowhere
Your shadow's fading away
Please don't leave me here this way.

Once in your lifetime
You can free yourself from your state of mind
Tell me why you are so scared of me
We can build together a place to hide.

Now, let me walk along with you just one more time
Walking in the streets of Paris
Stay, we can wait together for the morning light
'cause my heart is lost in Paris.

I've seen your face everywhere
Coming out of nowhere
Your shadow's fading away
Please don't leave me here this way.

Once in your lifetime
You can free yourself from your state of mind
Tell me why you are so scared of me
We can build together a place to hide

Night and day, I wanna take your time,
Face to face, show me the way,
Please don't cry, bring out a smile tonight,
Close your eyes, and deep in my soul...

Your emotional plans in your face,
Let your memories go far away...

Don't let your best years fade away,
Time, don't waste your time,
Run for your life, make up your mind...

When the night is coming
There's nothing more to do
She comes walking in silence
Always dressing in blue.

Your heartbeat seems to fade
Don't runaway anymore
Your anger burns inside
That's not the life you ask for.

This is the wind of change
There's nowhere to go
No time, no place to hide
Anywhere in the world.

You can get, you can get what you want
Life is so strange and so full of desires
Day by day, try to follow your way
The wind of change is burning out the fire.

Don't waste your time again
Too many years have gone
You are lying in the dark
Open yourself to the sun.

This is the wind of change
There's nowhere to go
No time, no place to hide
Anywhere in the world.

You can get, you can get what you want
Life is so strange and so full of desires
Day by day, try to follow your way
The wind of change is burning out the fire.

This is the wind of change
Please don't go
No time, no place to hide in the world

Gonna go to the top
Gonna fight, till I've got what I want

When I get to the top
All that holds me is a true bond

You will have to fight for me now
Then, I'm gonna show you how

Baby baby baby
Maybe maybe maybe
Maybe you can be the one tonight

If you stand by my side
You will see that they have to bow

They will all step aside
There's no way they can stop us now

Help me and everybody will see
How our life can really be

The club is full of beat, it's Friday night
Ready to rock the house 'til morning light
Movin' and groovin' just dancing the night away

Sweating and burning out there on the floor
Everybody movin' to nonstop music
The beat is thumping it makes you want some more

All the time is slippin' and my head is spinnin'
Don't stop the music, wanna dance forever
'Cause nothing can stop us now

Get up and jump to your feet
Come on and move to the beat
Just wanna dance all night long
Get up and jump to your feet
Come on and move to the beat
Dancing the night away

Excitement here and there, making new friends
There's so much fun I hope it never ends
Moving and grooving just dancing the night away

It's way past midnight and tension is high
Follow your heart let it flow to the sound
No time to sit around lets get in the groove

It's way past midnight and tension is high
Everybody movin' to non-stop music

One day on the street I saw you, baby
You were smiling at a pretty lady
Didn't you notice I was there, baby?
It's because I had a hair cut, maybe

I don't care who you are going out with
I don't care what you are going to do
I can tell you that you are at your zenith
I can tell I am a stranger to you

Don't you remember that I was part of your life
Once upon a time?
I still remember that I was in love with you
I was in my prime
And at last you walked away 'cause it was too much

I used to like to call you "My honey"
You used to like to go after money
When I dreamed about making a journey
You just dreamed about finding somebody

Don't you remember that I was part of your life
Once upon a time?
I still remember that I was in love with you
I was in my prime
And at last you walked away 'cause it was too much
Don't you remember that I was part of your life
Once upon a time?
I still remember that I was in love with you
I was in my prime
And at last you walked away 'cause it was too much

You pretend that you don't care, but
Every time I change my partner
You stare at my face and my strut
What is that if you really don't care?

Oh, take my hand, ask me now to dance
I cannot stand waiting for you
Now take my hand, don't go talk to someone else, Darling
You should know what you want

Keep on dancing tonight, I want to be a queen
Who can make you surrender, so
Keep on dancing tonight, I feel my power over you
Don't you know that you are mine?

Looking secretly at me, you
Smile at some girl standing by you
Are you trying to make me jealous?
I don't like the cheap thing you do

Trust me, and let yourself go
Why don't you give it all to me
Love me, I want you to know
If you're afraid, just let me show you
But, I want to get this straight out
Love in a rush is what I hate, so baby

Rush, my lover, it's not the way, to discover (baby)
Rush, oh my lover, it's not the right guide, give
yourself to me

See now, the way that we feel
Could lead to love and tender caring
Look how, it's getting so real
It seems like love that we are sharing
Wait, and see how this will go on
One day it will all be gone, so baby

I know, (I'll) tell ya what I think of you
Get mad, every time I see you
No doubt, just the biggest part of you
Is true, (it's) busting in my heart

I've got a feelin' for you
I'm waiting for you to do
Your body's lookin' so cool, believe me
Why why babe?
(I'll) tell you what I'm feeling
Every time I'm watching you....... I'm ready

Oh Cinderella
Why don't you show me your tit so big
Oh Cinderella
(I'm) beggin' keep on dancing with me

My soul, turning read and black
So cool, every time you're goin' to
To move, right the sexy part of you
Love you, (you're) living in my heart

I need your attention
Oh, tell me tell me, baby
Light my flame
I want your reaction
I wanna get up all the mornings
Boy, with you 

On this period, you
Take your coffee or watch tv
On the chair of living-room
Smoke your cigarette and I remember 

Magic moment
I want you, babe
Magic magic magic
On fire
Magic moment
I need you, babe
Magic the moment
Don't stop, keep and love me 

I like collection
I'm movin' up and down
To awake your sense
Don't change my direction
And move your time my little baby
Come on boy

You're still alive when you thinkin' of me
I got to move for everyday
You need to prove easy new sensation
I got to give you a new kind of play

I'm a man
Give out a new bang bang
I'm a man
Give out a new bang bang

And I feel that tonight
You need fresh in your life oh oh oh 
I got to do it love
Come on back in my room
There's a body to groom oh oh oh
I got to do it love for you

You're still alive till the end of the nite
I need again all tour body to bite
You're ready now for a new vibration
I got to give you a matter of fight

Up and down and look around
For special pleasure time
Close your eyes, don't ask me why
And try... my funny side

I can give your satisfaction
Baby try my mind
With your positive reaction
We can feel all right

Heroes of fantasy...
We look for extasy without love
Heroes of fantasy...
Ready for paradise all night long

Lost in time your dreams and soul
Are grooving in my life
Round & round out of control
I gotta make you mine

Lost on foreign shores
And something to look for
I can't resist, I'm carving your sweet name on the sand
The sun is gliding down
Shadows getting brown
To hear your voice  beyond the miles would make it so right

I wish you'd always been here by my side
Together we'd never cry
I need you now to fill my nights with love
Don't hang up the phone

Hold the line
Can't tell me it's the last time
Sudden words will never work it fine
Hold it tight
My heart is surrending
I'm ready for you
Baby just hold the line

Standing all alone
And staring at the phone
My burning castle quickly turns the fire to smoke
Just need a reason why
I dial your number twice
To hear your voice beyond the miles would make it so right

And loving you is what I need to work on
now
It seems that you look the other way
So why don't you appreciate my calling
I only have in my head your name

You realise that I can't work on my own
now
They say it takes two to tango
So join the dance, just give me all you got
now
I know you know you can't turn away

I'm the one you'll miss if you let me go
Don't let this happen to your heart
Turn to me and listen to what you know
Quit all your excuses and just tell me
"I love you"

Don't forget it I love you baby
You need to know it I love you too
And don't forget it you need me baby
We need to make a story for me and you,
me and you

Get up! come on!
The night is for desires
I'm on the way
And driving to the "starlight"
You have to move
(I)'m not the man who's waitin'
You're gonna see (that)
Tonight you'll be my lady

Take me take me baby
Yes I'm gettin' ready
Every lady love me too
Just enough you move it
I don't need to prove it
Tonight I'm gonna show you my rule

I wanna be your lover, baby
I wanna be your man
I wanna be your seventh heaven
I wanna be your superman

Baby go on!
My body burns on fire
Don't be ashamed
Relax and take me higher
I feel my blood
The pressure makes me crazy
Stay close to me
This time! You won't forget it!

Across the lights of this foggy city
Looking for a special feeling, in this crazy night
I'm spending all my desires

My brain is full of my lover's nightmares
My mind is running, and that I feel is lost and now
No more loves can take me higher

No one's gonna stop my desperation, now
I will ring up someone, who helps along the way

I'm just naked in the night
In my feeling in my soul
I've just lost the time, the
Memories of love

Babe!!!!

I'm just naked in the night
Running on the city light
Like a phantom looking for
Your loving soul

Tonight with my broken heart I'm running

I'm not an angel with love devotion
I try to search an emotion all around around
I drown my troubles, my sorrows

Please babe give me a strong sensation
'Cause I'm so strange and all my reaction over now
Please try to kill my obsession

I don't wanna waste no time
In the rest of my live
Baby I'm coming from Italy
To be part of your life

You had better try with my love
C'mon and live to the top
Tonight I'm ready to fly, latino
You had better try with my soul
I won't be loosing control
I got to love you my baby

I'm your lover, macho latino
I got to take you high, with my body
Baby believe me, I'm Valentino
Macho Latino Pizza Mandolino

I believe in love and pride
In the deep of my heart
Baby love me if you want to try
In the deep of the night

Every man loves a reality
Where the woman could be easy ladies
All the girls want to be free
Looking out the men
They just will

Baby, tell me what do you think
About the lonely love
The most of people make all nights
Baby, tell me if you agree tonight and over
To carry on the game of love

Another night of fantasy
Call me up and give me again your mad love
Another night of fantasy
Only for you only for me
Another night of fantasy
Call me up and give me again your mad love
Another night of fantasy
Do it for you, do it for me

Everyone lies in love to prove
Now they just can be the best of lovers
But no one should be so aware
That the feel we need
Must be real

When I dream then I hope
Things will change once for all
I deceive my feeling nature

Don't forget our truth
Can be mother of love
But seem you've just forgotten

Glamour kept in you
Can't use me like a broken toy, oh love
Affair must be alive
Don't wanna stop the music
No, so quiet

In the dark of my heart
In the dark of the night
Are you missing to come into my arms
After the hurricane, the rainbow,
It won't appear upon mu love

In the dark of my heart
In the light of the sun
I am missing the comin' to your arms
After the gale I glimpse the rainbow
It will appear in front of me...In the dark of my heart

Every Saturday night
Watch the moon in your eyes
That we broke much time before

Do the best of mind
I feel in your paradise
Grace of night
Music melody
You getta belong to me
Magic dream

Kaleidoscopic love
Tell me baby, what is your color, now
Tell me the truth once more
Dive into a dangerous love target

I don't wanna let you down
Gotta be what you'll discover
I don't wanna mess you around
Guilty, cause I'm guilty, babe

I don't wanna let you down
Won't you go, the night is over
I don't wanna mess you around
Guilty, I'm so guilty, babe

Love is like a train
Running along the rail 
Don't be afraid

Angel has gone by
Don't be a desperated guy
On this time

Everyday I dance without control
Every night I look someone to satisfy

You fly from man to younger
Your body and my soul
Ehy guy I'll make you wonder
Burning up around me

Queen of the night
People of the dark life
Every hottest part of me, now
Flash in the dark

"I was bad to ev'ryone to love
I just want to change my life now"

Screaming in the jungle

Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay

It's...
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!
Even though the sound of it
Is something quite atrocious
If you say it loud enough
You'll always sound precocious

Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay!

Because I was afraid to speak
When I was just a lad
My father gave me nose a tweak
And told me I was bad
But then one day I learned a word
That saved me achin' nose

The biggest word I ever heard
And this is how it goes: Oh!

Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!
Even though the sound of it
Is something quite atrocious
If you say it loud enough
You'll always sound precocious
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay!

He traveled all around the world
And everywhere he went
He'd use his word and all would say
"There goes a clever gent"

When Dukes and maharajas 
Pass the time of day with me
I say me special word and then
They ask me out to tea

Oh..
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!
Even though the sound of it
Is something quite atrocious
If you say it loud enough
You'll always sound precocious
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay!

So when the cat has got your tongue
There's no need for dismay
Just summon up this word
And then you've got a lot to say
But better use it carefully
Or it could change your life

One night I said it to me girl
And now me girl's my wife!

I was born in a little town
As the only sister, not so pretty !!!

I grew up without all those things
That a women needs to make her fashion

And everyday I'm still praying that
Behind any wall of neighbour
Someone call me and drag me away
With his long black car

BIG TROUBLE waiting for the time when my
Life it changes on
BIG TROUBLE gotta have a time better
Than this time for sure

I was born in the street alone
And without my brothers they were working

In the street you've got just yourself
Anybody else is there to help you

Baby c'mon
You got to show the world
The love you're feelin' for dance music
So don't you fight it
No no don't you hide it
Hey c'mon deejay

C'mon and step out the floor
They love you baby, give them more nad more
No way to fake it
Music is something natural
And beautiful so

Dance dance dance, dance monsteru
Turn up the heat on the floor now baby
Shake shake shake, shake it monsteru
So take me higher
Set the place on fire

Dance dance monsteru
Come down with me
And I will make you see
The night will be just full of fire
So don't you fight it
Tell me that you like it
Your feet are movin'
Steppin' out and groovin'

Don't give up
Let the people run around you
For many times
People want (to)
Get excited with a great sound
Beating for you

Loud, loud sing it
Just enough you scream it
Your body moves (and)
They get stuck in your groove
Down town rhythm
"Get into my groove with me"
Just enough you feel it

Dance is back! all right
They're gonna sing it loud with you & me uoh uoh!
Dance is back this time
Because we're gonna hit & feel the beat

Getting touched
People need to feel your deep sound
Dancin' around
Turn it on
Volume of your shining hi-fi
That's time to dance

Pictures in the baggage
Make up as a language
That's my life and that's my job too
Sandwich in a pocket
Keeping tight my ticket
Up and down to work around

Ooh!!!

Baby, baby, baby, it's crazy life
Without the beautiful things my mother said to me
Lady, lady, lady, yes I'm ready
Gimme the start and I'll be there

GIRLS ON FILM
Parade of naked bodies

Upside down to sell myself

Ooh!!!

Just you, anyway (and)
Anytime is only for you and me

No more fear
But the way for feeling fine
If you want, is so easy, I've been around
Like before

Ready to go! I wanna get out!

There she stands on the floor
colder than ice,
Vision Fixed on the door
colder than ice
Now she knows that she's nice
Golden hair and deep blue eyes
No one dances her twice
Nothing happened so far
Cuz' now won't you get burned by the ice?

Who will reach her tonight before she takes flight?
She's colder than ice
How can't I get in thirst, her in tights?
She's colder than ice
Colder than ice, Colder than ice

Suddenly I was there
and she's in his arms
All so close to him
and she feels his charms
Can't see her no more
Could it be I'll lose her for sure
Oh it's breaking me up
Cuz' I'm the only one
who dares to walk on the ice

Who will reach her tonight before she takes flight?
She's colder than ice
How can't I get in thirst, her in tights?
She's colder than ice
Who will reach her tonight before she takes flight?
She's colder than ice
How can't I get in thirst, her in tights?
She's colder than ice
Colder than ice
She's colder than ice

Colder than ice

Listen boy, don't you cry
The love between us is over
I just wanna say bye
I miss the freedom in my life

You have to understand my feelings
And the decisions that I chose
'Cause if we stay together, love is lost
And we lose............

Look upon the bright side
GONNA BE ALL RIGHT
Will you take my advise
And look upon the bright side
GONNA BE ALL RIGHT

Please stop asking me why
The love between us is over
You stay out every night
And I don't really think it's right

I don't want to stay infront of you
Spending those few big words
I just want to let you know
That I'm with you

Let me dive into the parapara fire, babe

Rumiringo, let your body go
Rumiringo lucky star
Super Manba, dance without control
Rumiringo superstar!

Dancing parapara, techno and eurobeat
Now you are the star in many videos, oh babe

Tell me if you really feel like a superstar
Every day, every night Japan is crazy for you

I was alone and sad in my mind
just a dream
Try to find out a beautiful lover
and now like a strawberry upon an
ice-cream
I can choose between blonde and
brown lovers

Now or never I never had two
boy friends
But my mind's open to this
Now or never I never had two
boy friends
That give me twice a kiss

Let's try a love in stereo love to the left
and the right
With love in stereo looks like I'm
gonna find
With love in stereo I'm gonna lose all
my mind
In stereo how can anything feel
so good

Believe me now I couldn't believe in
my eyes
Everything in three now is much better
Triangle's full of happiness nobody
cries
Maybe this time love will laster forever

Baby I'm so lucky
I just can't believe it
Every night is burning up with you
Baby it's so funny
Got a crazy feeling
Everyday is getting bright for me

You've been away for such a lone time
I keep on loving you
And every time you were on my mind
Everyday every night

Hot summer nights you'll be my lover
Hot summer nights you'll be the one
Hot summer nights ain't got a fever
Hot summer nights you'll be the cure

Baby it's amazing
Got a crazy feeling
Everything you do is good for me
I just wanna do it

Every night is getting hot with you

Baby, baby, baby
Magic is the feeling

Heartbeat
It's the ache that I'm feeling when you
Want me
So deep in my heart
Got to
To resist at the attacks of your body,
Well, I'm losing control

Now as you can see
I'm proud of your attention
You want only me

Baby let me be
The hand of your protection

One more chance is what I got to
Show you that I need you, oh baby let me start
One more chance you got to give me
I know it seems so crazy but make you understand

Wake me
Wake me up from my dreams I want to
Move me
Till I will be strong enough
Don't you
Don't you try to understand what I am feelin'
I want to leave you apart

Just some talking and approaching set you free
From the steely chains wrapped around your soul
Only real communication you can try
To connect your body with some boys and girls

Please don't think about love that never knocked at your door
Change in positive and you'll be not lonely, not anymore

Wonder why... love is a destiny, got to believe in it
Don't ask me why
Wonder why... forget the memories showing a deadly boy
That says good bye
Wonder why... love even fortifies good times and bad times
They have made you cry
Wonder why... better to tell a lie
Too many broken hearts will live or die

Wonder why...

You can changing with your dancing wild and free
Look yourself around and searching for the joy
Do reaction and the love will spread you wings
Like an eagle catching for your girl and boy

Across the time
Across the limits of my life
Everyday, I start my passion
My secret reaction high

Follow me
We can control the best emotion
Follow me
Run out of destiny devotion

Take my time

The moon light is full of extasy
A magic adventure you and me - follow me

Crazy, lost
Walking on the streets just like an alien freak

Baby, I know
Baby, I see it crystal clear now
No regrets but now

Why can't I dream away
Dream away
Got my heart to make my day
Got my mind I still believe

Why don't you dream away
Dream away from me
Baby, nothing you can stay
Ever makes me wild and free

Now the sky's the darkest blue
Missin' you
I just can't bring back old feelings veiled in black

I look around like in a dream
My door's got crazy keys
The sky above's too high
For me

But people help me feel alive
I'm comin' back in style
And find the joys in store
For me

Never worry, take your time
Fallen heroes out of mind
Just close your eyes and smile

And every heart wanna fly
Let me try and try and
Grow the wings of love
I'll never let them go tonight

Don't wanna dance alone
So let the music carry every heart

Wanna fly
It's a cloud to make you
Feel so cold and blue
The sun's
Above

Sometimes I feel the world go round
I fear I'm fallin' down
But I feel dizzy
Time and time

Tell me, my lover,
Is it me or the others?
Show me, you love me,
If you don't let me know

You don't want me to go
But I think I'm gonna get away
I'm gonna get away
I don't love you anymore
But I'm keep on callin' out your name
I'm callin' out your name now

CIAO CIAO BYE BYE
I know I will miss you

CIAO CIAO BYE BYE
But I don't I wanna loose you
Tonight

Maybe tomorrow
We'll again be together
Seasons will follow
Tough we feel common sorrow

Tonight I know that I'm just a girl
Tonight I know that ya just a boy
I'm gonna teach you to move on my body
All night long

And you think that you are running away from me
And you think that you can live on your own
And you gonna get away baby can't you see that
You are wrong

And I'm livin' in lover forever
One for me

Someone has her heart set on you
In this world so strange and blue

Livin' away, day after day
Thinkin' I got it easy
And I don't care what's in the air
Thinkin' that's all about

If there's no soul within
I think we got it rough
Livin' out the mess I'm in

No, no, don't you shout!
I don't wanna keep you out
Come on, don't you scream!
I still wanna live the dream
Oh no, don't let go!
Did I ever say no more?
Don't wanna blow you away

It's because of you
I thought that I knew
And now what is left to me?
The more I give the more you take
To feel complete
Just to feel complete

Because of you
I've never been true
I never really knew
I was just the man to please your ecstasy
For your ecstasy
Just because of you

You're always in my mind
and I was feeling blind
Now can you face the fact
That I'm not turning back?
I gave up everything
And it was just for you
Money, glory, fame
My soul and god even more

No, no, don't you shout!
I don't wanna keep you out
Come on, don't you scream!
I still wanna live the dream
Oh oh, don't let go!
Did I ever say no more?
Don't wanna blow you away

Because of you
I've never been true
I never really knew
I was just the man to please your ecstasy
For your ecstasy
Because of you
Just because of you

So you hide all alone, how do you feel girl?
Turn around, take my hand, look at me now
Just because of you, because of you,
because of you, because of you

You really made a mess of me - no baby don't deny it
A ghost of my nights so sweet - I will forget about it
Your love like a nail in deep - but now it's healin' away
You let me here to blood
I'll mend alone this bitter feelin'

I'll fight the fears
And dry my tears
Won't try any more oh never no more
The words so pure
They're punchin' bold
And startin' to blow

Get out of my head
Get out of my heart
Away baby, I
Won't fall apart
Get out of my head
Get out of my heart
I'm telling you I
Won't fall apart
I'll smile again
Run again
No one else nobody nobody
Cheatin' me
Foolin' me
Like you did nobody nobody no

You think I'll be there on my knees - no baby don't deny it
In pieces cryin' out my pain - I will forget about it
I'll breathe alone I feel so free - but now it's healin' away
I'll let you dream your dream
Away from me, hands off my feelings

There's a guy who's dancing just in front of me and sways
He's attractive 'cause his body plays some "sexy games"
He's in love... uh uh yeah
He's in love, he's in love, he's in love
Standing like a statue I can see his face
And he smiles because he knows that I just started my chase
He's in love... uh uh yeah
He's in love

But I can do it easy 'cause he knows I can
Just enough I treat him so cool
(I) do it so easy

I need a spier man
Fall into my trap
'Cause I know you like my bed
I need a spider man
Stay with me tonight
And you'll prove my touch's delight
Good time baby!!!
My love is so happy... that's the solution

Baby pretty baby I can take him home
Now he's hot and he got ready for the night to come
He's in love... uh uh uyeah
He's in love, he's in love, he's in love
All night long I spend the time in bed with him
There's no time to lose, I have to move: he likes it yeah
He's in love... uh uh yeah
He's in love

You want a sweet lovey love and take what you need
You say you just adore me
You change your mind, you cry you're wild burnin' free
Go messin' round without me

Turn me upside down
Like I was your clown
Got to laugh and cry
Say hello goodbye
Slave of your desire

What d'you want from me?
What d'you want from me?
Off me -
Just tell me when you're gonna
I'm sure right here
You'll find nobody - just find nobody
What d'you want from me?
What d'you want from me?
Off me -
Just call me when you're gonna
Right beside you, you'll find nobody - oh find nobody

Shake it up now baby shake it up now
Check it out check it out right now

I only say everything that you wanna hear
No real communication
You make me feel like a lonely king of the world
You like a standin' ovation

Oh can't you feel
All the love between us
All the love between us
Please say to me
We can change forever,
We can change forever, be safe with me

What d'you want from me

You just live in a deep hole
Why you don't believe it
Hey, it's not so easy for you

I just don't understand why
Give up crazy fellow
Yeah, you're in a hell now

You don't feel desire
There's not one reason, you see
To give up to passion
Live for today
Just do it ever and ever
Lover to lover

You drive my body babe
Dreaming to be together
You live my body babe
Life is a game for lovers

Girl you live in big doubt
Why you don't believe it
God, it's just so crazy for you
You cannot live in stand by
Give up crazy sorrow
Dreams are here to borrow

Last night you talked about leaving
I said I can't let you go
It's not just emotional feeling
I need your body and soul

You give me one good reason to leave me
I'll give you ten good reasons to stay
You're the only one I believe in
I'll be hurt, I'll be hurt
If you walk away

Too many broken hearts in the world
There's too many dreams
Can be broken in two
Too many broken hearts in the world
So I won't give up the fight for you

The world is full of lonely people
Who never held on to love
Last night I tried to reach you
But somehow it wasn't enough

So I said can't you wait a bit longer
I'll give you all that a lover should give
It ain't my pride but my love that is stronger
I'll be hurt, I'll be hurt
If you walk away

Too many broken hearts in the world
There's too many dreams
Can be broken in two
Too many broken hearts in the world
So I won't give up the fight for you

You give me one good reason to leave me
I'll give you ten good reasons to stay
You're the only one I believe in
I'll be hurt, I'll be hurt
If you walk away

Too many broken hearts in the world
There's too many dreams
Can be broken in two
Too many broken hearts in the world
So I won't give up the fight for you

From the silent of the mountain
To the rumours of the city
Love is like a rainbow for all the people

Without frontier without limits
Black and white in touch together
Ready for the world
Full of peace and freedom

Everybody in touch together
The life is harmony
We can change the world forever
Only with the passion
Today with love we can fly to the heaven
Kiss me forever sing with me

We sing for freedom
Over the world
We sing for freedom
Only for love
We sing for freedom
Humanity
Set them free set them free set them free

We sing for freedom
Over the world
We sing for freedom
Only for love

Sweet harmony
Set them free set them free set them free

Far from London far from Tokyo
We can stop the blood and fighter
Many people ask for special prayer

Ready for a new dimension
Full of peace and love attention
Waiting for a place
Full of satifactions

Run in the dark
I'm gonna let the past apart
You wanna touch the stars, ouph
Got in the heat
Runnin' to blast the past in time
My future state of mind, ouph

I see you fire
Higher, gettin' closer, can you free me?
Making us so real
Now feel me baby
Touch my heart and ready, join that dream

I'm smashin' thru the gate, ouph
You've got the feel
You gonna turn the spinnin' wheel,
Turnin' on forever, ouph

Running back in time - so long, so long ago
Walkin' together in the moonlight
Holdin' oh so tight

And the night just smiled
In the gold of the risin' sun
But the stars in your eyes
Were shinin' out forever

Falling in love again, with you!
It's gonna take my heart and soul
Falling in love just every night with you
Fallin' in love

Lookin'out for love again-oh love again
Baby I know you try to find
Alone my crazy mind

And the night just smiled
In the gold of the risin' sun
But the stars in your eyes
Were shinin'out forever

Falling in love again, with you!
It's gottae take my heart and soul
Fallin' in love just every night with you
Emotion blue

Falling in love just every night with you
Fallin' in love

Don't you deny
Bits of heaven
I feel your life
Under my fingers

Stop for a moment
Let your body shine
That perfect happiness, love
Enjoy for once in your life

Hi love, higher
We're takin' the skyway
Hi love, higher
And leave the shadows here aground
Hi love, higher
We're goin' up somewhere
Hi love, higher
And we'll be shootin' stars flyin' high

You hesitate
Feel my heartbeat
Oh, don't be late
Follow the feeling

In the moonlight
Shine in the blue
Now put on your bright funny light

Runnin' in the dark of the night around
Beautiful and proud for me

Take all my wishes
My little little star
Go fly around the world
Keep smilin' until the morning
You travel'd so far
My little little star
Freak out tonight so bright, so bright!

On your way we're gonna be fine
We walked on some clouds so high

Black over my heart
And the flame of a star on fire
Back right from the start
I just wanna take over again my life

Wanna shine bright
Nobody else is gonna take this chance for me
Let my mind fly
Wanna feel now and forever
Just like tonight

I'm alive
Don't wanna lose again
My luck, let's celebrate freedom now
I'm alive
I've got my special way
To let all the feelings go wild
I'm alive
Don't wanna lose again
My luck, let's celebrate freedom now
I'm alive
I've got my special way
To let all the feelings go wild

Go right to the beat
And enjoy life is just a ride
Out into the street
There's a way you can go make you feel so right

Dragon out of the night
Golden heart forever burnin', so proud
Warriors' flame in the light
Runnin' higher and higher I'm loosin' my ground

For another world we're reachin' out
A glorious delight so wonderful
Show me show me your love baby now
I'm callin' it out to your heart

Imagine
There is a cloud
Where we can dream up in the night
Build castles in the sky
Can you imagine
To cry aloud
"I got you, hold me in the dark
And love me to the stars"
Can you imagine

Swimmin' out to sea
Holdin' on, discover an ocean of love
Divin' into the deep
Sinkin' down and down will you'll get to the core

I feel your love tonight
Changin' all my life

Walkin' around
I just see the lonely hearts goin' by
Nothing inside my mind
Feeling the sound (that) goes here inside
The voice of the old times

I am the king of the night life
I only long on my own today
Untill the darkness will last
I'm walkin' by through the street all alone

Dance with me
Dancing in the street
And I feel like having you beside me
Dance with me
Dancing in the street
Oh I'm just pretending to be better

Turnin' around

Nothing can be so bright
Feeling the sound, the light of the stars
The moon and the planets

Stopping the fight that I dreamed with you

Leave an empty place into my heart
Shut your door of reason, then you believe

Hit my hammer, taste of freedom
Freedom night

Well, lay back and relax
While I put away the dishes
Then you and me can rock-a-bye

You can ring my bell, ring my bell
You can ring my bell, ring my bell
You can ring my bell, ring my bell
You can ring my bell, ring my bell

The night is young and full of possibilites
Well, come on and let yourself be free
My love for you so long I've been saving
The night was made for me and you

Never been to Venice, never been to China
Ever been to any place you've been to
When you talk about it, you seem like a stranger
Are you thinking of some place you're gone to?

But you don't know, that I've been waiting for you
Let me tell you, Let me say
Well if you really need me and really love me, darling
Don't you go, don't you go away

Take me to your paradise and
Let me know the greatest time that you had before
Take me to your paradise and
Make me feel that you're gonna stay evermore
'Cause I have never been to, to deep inside your heart

Never been to Paris, never been to Turkey
Never got to see the things in common
Your life is so different. Earth is tiny to you
I just want to hear you say yeah, c'mon

Take me to your paradise and
Let me know the greatest time that you had before
Take me to your paradise and
Make me feel that you're gonna stay evermore
Take me to your paradise and
Let me know the greatest time that you had before
Take me to your paradise and
Make me feel that you're gonna stay evermore
'Cause I have never been to, to deep inside your heart

You promised me that you would never, ever leave me crying
You promised me that you would never, ever let me go

But suddenly somethin' went wrong
I should have known it all along
'Cause it was too good to be true
That I could hold a wanderer like you

Baby it's just too soon to say good-bye
We can't be through now
Give it some time, we really never got a chance to start
Baby it's just too soon to say good-bye
What can I do now
To keep you in my arms and keep the passion in your heart?

You promised me that you would always, always stay beside me
You promised me that you would always always be around

But now you're headin' out the door
You're sayin' you need to explore
You hear the wind callin' your name
I wonder if you will be back again

But suddenly somethin' went wrong
I should have known it all along
'Cause it was too good to be true
That I could hold a wanderer like you

Since you came into the room, I've just been started
staring at your blue eyes.
But you are keeping me out of your sight.
Are you afraid of ties?
We broke up already you would say.
I don't think it's been true between us.
It's you that turns away from what we try to share.

I'm gonna hold you, and kiss you, and make you
feel like you're the only one I need.
And you can hold me, and kiss me, and make me
feel like I'm the only one you need.
What are you tryin' to do to me?
Let's get in motion.

There's something I have to say, my baby.
You must have got me wrong.
Don't you remember we helped each other?
There's no need to be strong.
We haven't talked enough, I would say.
If you don't want to listen to me
You know that we'll be losing what we try to share.

We haven't talked enough, I would say.
If you don't want to listen to me
You know that we'll be losing what we try to share.

The first time I saw you, I knew you were meant for me
And since then each day has been nothing but ecstasy
No one else can do all the breathtaking things you do 
I just lose control every time I get next to you

Kiss me and tell me you'll stay right here - never let me go
Tell me your dreams and then I'll tell you mine
And we'll make them come true, don't you know - wo, wo

You are the one that I've been waiting for so long
You're the one who sets my heart on fire
You are the one, you are my only love song
You're the one who fills me with desire
You are the one that I've been waiting for so long
You are the one who sets my heart on fire
You are the one, you are my only love song
You're the one who fills me with desire - yeah

Every time I look at you, I feel my knees go weak
I just lose my mind and I can't even think or speak

Hold me and tell me we'll always be as we are today
Promise me that all the dreams that we have
will be real and will be here to stay - ay, ay

Always on my mind
I've been through love and out
But I'm not a gir, you see
Baby, you are haunting me
But I'm not afraid
I'm not your game
I surrender all my heart
That I give you everything
So you can make me
Don't forget me all the time

I know I am in all your dreams
You are looking me all the time

If somebody's storming
Just to take my heart in hand
If somebody's strong in me again
If somebody's giving
That you are always on my mind
If somebody's loving me tonight

And you've driven million miles
Just to be with me tonight
Baby, you are haunting me
I'm not afraid, I'm not a game

I know I am in all your dreams
Everynight
You are looking for me all the time

Always on my mind...

I don't care if you don't feel me deep inside
I don't care if you tell me that time goes by
Stay away from me
I love another man yes it's true

I don't know why my mind has been hit by him
I don't know why he's changing my soul in deep
And I feel for him
A tender love that's broken my heart

I am shaking your feelings
I don't know what you are thinking tonight
I don't care what people say about my life (I'm sad)

Hot love I wanna love
Only hot love babe I know
Hot love I wanna show
Only hot love babe I want you just for me
Oh babe I wanna be free

I don't care if you can give me love again
I will share all my love with another man
A losing game for you
I love another man yes it's true

The first time I saw you, I knew you were meant for me.
And since then each day has been nothin' but ecstasy.
No one else can do all the breathtaking things you do.
I just lose control every time I get next to you.

Kiss me and tell me you'll stay right here - never let me go.
Tell me your dreams and then I'll tell you mine
and we'll make them come true, don't you know - wo, wo.

You are the one that I've been waiting for so long.
You're the one who sets my heart on fire.
You are the one, you are my only love song.
You're the one who fills me with desire.
You are the one that I've been waiting for so long.
You're the one who sets my heart on fire.
You are the one, you are my only love song.
You're the one who fills me with desire - yeah.

Every time I look at you, I feel my knees go weak.
I just lose my mind and I can't even think or speak.

Hold me and tell me we'll always be as we are today.
Promise me that all the dreams that we have

I can feel your beat carry me away
Come on baby, do it again
That's the way to reach a new desire
Come on baby, sing it again
Get into the groove to a new day

U.S.A. Do you feel my love is getting stronger
U.S.A. With your body, you can melt with water
U.S.A. Running way before the night is over
U.S.A. Baby, come to me but don't take over

So shy you seem, careful to care not at all.
Spin around, spin around
Clinging to your heart so it won't fall.
But what is the truth under the mask that you wear?
Let it go, let it go
Throw away the foolish pride inside.

Follow the magic in the music,
All of your wildest dreams come true.
Don't be afraid of your emotions,
Think of what's waiting for you.

A brand new world opens up its loving arms to you.

Wake up, desire! (I need you, don't you know?)
Light up your fire! (I love you, don't you know?)
Go cast your spell and make her love me,
Please, please, please!
Wake up, desire! (I want you, no, no, no!)
Light up her fire! (I love you, no, no, no!)
Old devil rhythm, turn her heart to me.

You turn away, claiming you want to be free
Spin around, spin around
Warm and safe inside your loneliness.
But don't be afraid of heartbreaks that may never be.
Let it go, let it go
Take away the mask and look my way.

Open your mind and feel the music,
Ride on the tide of the swelling tune.
Fighting your heart is like a wave
Fighting the pull of the moon.

Look in my eyes, can't you see I want you here in my arms?

Wake up, desire! (You want me, don't you know?)
Light up your fire! (You need me, don't you know?)
Go cast your spell and make her love me,
Don't leave me hanging on forever,
Stop, stop! (Baby, come on! Don't stop the music!)
Wake up, desire! (I want you, no, no, no!)
Light up her fire! (I love you, no, no, no!)
Old devil rhythm, bring her love to me.

Come feel the ecstasy,
Come dance away with me,
Hold me tight, hold me tight!

Wake up, desire! (I want you, no, no, no!)
Light up her fire! (I love you, no, no, no!)
Old devil rhythm, bring her home to me.

Lights in your eyes, (it's) time for the laser beams on
There are the stars shinin', there are the people praying
On this planet Earth
Face to face, it is the key to the kingdom
It isn't hard to find it right by the people on the streets

You might be getting a little afraid of being loved
Don't cry now, there should be a chance for real life
It's the time, to stand up, for your feel, for your love
Take your chance and hope, more and more...

Dreams and love, shake your body and soul, eternally
You were born here, YES, exotic Japan
Dreams and love, shake your body and soul, eternally
We were born here, SO, exotic Japan, exotic Japan
Japan...  Japan...  Japan...  Japan...

Burning love, suddenly it finds you and comes to you
There are people loving, there are people living
All over the world
Hold me now, I can make you fly and feel the love
It is sad without it, try to have some fun

You used to cry all night, searching for love
Tears never stopped, it looked like the end of the world
Look at the sky, sail the sea, to the world, of your love
Love and hope, more and more...

Dreams and love, shake your body and soul, eternally
You were born here, YES, exotic Japan
Dreams and love, shake your body and soul, eternally
We were born here, SO, exotic Japan, exotic Japan
Japan...  Japan...  Japan...  Japan...

"Fight for your love, fight for your love"
"Fight for your love, fight for your love"
"Fight for your love, fight for your love"

Dreams and love, shake your body and soul, eternally
You were born here, YES, exotic Japan
Dreams and love, shake your body and soul, eternally
We were born here, SO, exotic Japan, exotic Japan
Japan...  Japan...  Japan...  Japan...

YO SAY. Summer love...
Wishing revealing...

YO SAY. Summer love...
Wishing revealing...
Precious love is always eating up my heart

Uncheatable her shapely line
A convict of her lithe crime
Save me and wrap around one more time
Make a change and turn around under a wave
Back on ground holding scolding the darker side

The summer is burning a hole in my heart
Stripping me down to hot temptation
It's OK to give in be beaten by lust, summer wind,
Burning air a scandal affair

YO SAY. Summer love will stimulate my heart tonight
Mysterious mermaid barefoot all alone
Wishing revealing it's the fruit I want to eat
Precious love is always eating up my heart

Fairies, summer folk will stimulate my fantasies
Mysterious mermaid barefoot all alone
Wishing revealing it's the fruit I want to eat
Precious love is always eating up my heart

Fagged out that's you and me, gave you the better side of me
This town is gloomy nothing to be found
Don't wanna stop or cool down, go forever not hang around
Don't wanna hear a boring joke in my open mind

The sky is burning a firework delight
Painting colour through the night
Holding me tightly I grab the light, summer wind,
Burning fire, getting me high

YO SAY. Summer love will stimulate my heart tonight
Mysterious mermaid barefoot all alone
Wishing revealing it's the fruit I want to eat
Precious love is always eating up my heart

Fairies, summer folk will stimulate my fantasies
Mysterious mermaid barefoot all alone
Wishing revealing it's the fruit I want to eat
Precious love is always eating up my heart

YO SAY. Summer love...
Wishing revealing...
Precious love is always eating up my heart
YO SAY. Summer love...
Wishing revealing...
Precious love is always eating up my heart

Whenever we are together
I feel the passion of love
And burning desire
I want to hold you forever
I want to kiss you all over
And feel the fire

I dream of you
And I dream of us together
Forever and ever
Let's never be apart
I dream of you
And I dream of us together
Don't take this love away
And break my heart

Oh baby - we need more communication
We need to show each other sexy love
Oh baby - we need more happy sensations
We need to find the love we're dreaming of

We need boom boom body talk
Up and down and all around
Boom boom body talk every day
Boom boom body talk
In and out until you shout
Boom boom body talk for your love

Whenever we are together
I feel a magic in the air
Magic you and me
I want a romantic lover
I need your kisses
Because our love is almighty

I stand with my head on fire
She touched me a real live wire
She's so cold in passion
Clothed in wildest fashion
There's no escape but running wild

She came like a perfect stranger
I thought she was heaven sent
She danced like a fallen angel
Flashing thru the sky still I wonder why

Crazy girl do you come from heaven
Crazy girl take me into the light
Crazy girl can't you see I'm burning
Will you take me higher
Will you take me ever so high

Tonight she's my wildest fancy
Inside it's my heart that's dancing
Up and down and screaming
Crazy in her rhythm
I have no choice but take her away

This time let me ride the tiger
Show me that your love is power
Lover of the night
Diamond shining bright
I'm lost without my crazy girl

I'm gonna move you
I'm gonna shake you
While you're living the night
Lights in the city
Girls are so pretty
Everybody is all right

So come on and dream
Now you can sing, babe
Music in you
Just get in the groove
Cause I just wanna be your fantasy

King of music
King of music
King of eurobeat
Satisfaction, singing, dancing eurobeat

King of music
King of music
King of eurobeat
I will be your king
The king of eurobeat

No hesitation
I need your devotion
Shake your body for me
The night is so crazy
Now don't be lazy
We're gonna live in a dream

What good's sitting at home
All alone on the shelf?
If you want to find romance, you've got to find it yourself
The someone I'm waiting for
Is somewhere waiting for me
So somewhere is the place I've really got to be

Lots of fish in the sea
But you need the right bait
To hook a tall, and tan, and, young and handsome
Saturday mate
I'll go pick out a dress
Something sexy, but smart
Gotta catch his eye to capture his heart

Gotta make it easier to notice me there
You may not get a second try
Mr. Right may be passing you by
Don't you sit there, get him
While the getting is good

Boy meets girl
It happens all the time
Suddenly it hits you, with no reason or rhyme
Fall in love
Do you believe in miracles?
Listen to the god of romance!

Take the sexy young me
Into a trendy new club
Where the young and rich and famous bring their elders to rub 
But in an elegant throng I feel my confidence sink 
I think I need a very alcoholic drink

So then I put down a gin
And ask for more of the same
I hear a gentle voice say "Thank you Madame, what is your name?" 
I pick my head off the bar And see him smiling at me 
And all at once I feel I own the earth and sea

Do you see the way that he looks into my eyes?
My heart is beating wild
Says "Here's your change" and touches my hand
And I'm reeling
Reeling
Feelings I've never known

Boy meets girl
Can happen anywhere
And before you know it you are walking on air
Fall in love
It's happy even after
Listen to the god of romance

I wander out and check my horoscope today
It says my lucky stars are out tonight
And that a person's gonna come into my life
And love me and be with me now tomorrow
And then forever more
Oh yeah!

People give you my life through music
Feel the rhythm tonight, I'm crazy
Parapara deep in my heart
I must be Tokyo's superstar

C'mon, I give you love, you give me energy
When I'm dancing on stage, you make me feel free
Tender devotion and desire
Give you every night

Oh baby, Nori nori nori
Singing for the glory
Para para dancing eurobeat (uoo ooo!)
Nori nori nori
Baby, don't be sorry
Para para music, baby take me higher
Nori nori nori
Life is but a story
Para para dancing eurobeat (uoo ooo!)
Nori nori nori
Baby, don't be sorry
Para para music, baby light my fire!

Baby take me tonight, I'm ready
Feel my passion, oh don't be lazy
Parapara deep in my mind
I wanna love you Tokyo guys

I can't wait anymore in this position
I've never felt any love like that
I can't stand in this lucky situation
I feel the fire is burning me

In my heart deep inside
Beats a new love...
In my veins in my blood
(It's) Flowing so fast...
In my mind in my brain
Everyday...
And it's not just a heartbeat

BIG, BIG, BANG, BANG, BANG
DEEP, DEEP, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN
BIG, BIG, BANG, BANG, BANG
What can I do
BIG, BIG, BANG, BANG, BANG
DEEP, DEEP, DOWN, DOWN INSIDE
uo uo uo...

I can't do anything in this position
I have to live in a labyrinth
(I) can't go to anywhere well I'm in
tension
I have to walk over step by step

Love is like an angel
Love is like a sister caring for you
Walking in the street you can see the faces
That are looking without love

Love is like a weapon
Everyday you can feel pointed to you
Love is in your heart, anyone all around
Goes to take it away
Babe I just want it all

Feeling like a new star
Getting crazy for nothing
Babe I just want it now
Feeling like superman
Flying faster than lightning
May be because I know that

Love is like a HEART ON FIRE
You better believe it
Always on the right step
Love is running on the wire
Pick up your stuff and
Keep on living your life

Love is like a brandy
Always in your house and getting you hot
Love is in your heart, anyone all around
Goes to take it easy

I get ready ready for you
I've been walking around my neighbour
I've been watching, looking for you

I tell you something about
Your gettin' closer to me
'Cause I find out your secret
I know you're feeling surprised
You wanna ask me
What I do to know all your mind

INTUITION It's a vision flowing through
It's my nature
INTUITION reputation that I like so much
I can't stop it
INTUITION It's a vision flowing through
It's my nature
INTUITION reputation that I like so much 
I can't stop it

Don't be careful I'm not a danger
Don't you be afraid of me
I can read everything you're thinking
But you're always thinking so good

Every moment you call my name
Every moment of the day
Trying to name all your dreams come true
Trying to make me yours

Don't you be an intrusive man
Leave me leave me alone
Let me let me stay in
I say please don't you step my way
You're the best invader I know

It's an invation "INVATION OF PRIVACY"
'Cause I don't want to love you
Like an invation invation of my belief
I feel you too closer

Every message you send to me
Every step you take for me
It's like a nightmare I had last night
When you were kissing me

You with your stupid life you think to be so fine
You're wrong babe!!!
I don't need it at all I just don't need your love
Keep it for ya!!!

I'm gonna live alone!
I've got everything I need
I wanna be free now
I'm gonna find the words
To say what I think about
All your talkin'

MORE THAN YOUR LOVE	I just wanna be side tonight
MORE THAN YOUR LOVE	I'm just feeling around me
MORE THAN YOUR LOVE	I just want to get up tonight
MORE THAN YOUR LOVE	I'm just looking around me

You with your stupid smile you think to be so good
But you crazy
No I don't want your love I got the power to
Live without it

Always MISSING YOU
And I will always miss your electric touch on me
Always loving you
And I will always love your expansive way 
To live

And it is not for money
I'm in love
And it is not for wasted time
And it is not to make you mine

MISSING YOU
And day by day I keep on
MISSING YOU
I feel how (I) love you
MISSING YOU
I wanna say I keep on
MISSING YOU
I think I love you

I still think of you
And I will always think of your accent from U.K.
I still wait for you
And I will always wait for your step behind my back

Come in come in come into my arms
Let me love, so you can try to help me
Touch me touch me touch me as you know
Let me feel your touch, it's magic

You can't go away
Don't you know my way
Come together oh love, don't make mistake

Back into my mind
All the time alone
Where is it, my love? Tell me honey

Come together come together
Don't you believe me, in this way I love you

Let me feel your smell so magic

Walking the street for money
Believe me babe calling them all "MY HONEY"
Leaving too fast the neighbours
I'm walking just for money but not with you

Always feeling a liar
I don't wanna lie with you
Screaming up my desire
I just wanna taste your body

Because I'm just like you want me
In your dreaming
Don't let me feel so lonely
And give me another chance to
Be loved by you

I was looking for a sunny day to light my heart
I saw the sun on your face I saw the look of your eyes
In the middle of the beach you play the ball
And the wind through the hair
I wanna know you
Boy !!!

Tell me how is your life
Tell me some to make simple

So you can send a message just to me
Can you SPEAK IN ENGLISH

Rolling to the sand and walking naked
Next to you
I try to have your attention but you give it away
When you laugh and when you joke you turn me on
'Cause I'm lost in your smile I wanna know you
Boy !!!

I am the monster of love
You are the prey I catch aside
I'll take you to my castle

So dark and dangerous you love
The monster of love

Baby call me Frankenstein

You don't feel bad emotions in my dreams
I am burning like a flame when you play this dirty game
Let me feel, let me live in the action,
Won't you kill...?

You like the blood of my love
I have a sight you can't abide
I'll make you feel my sorrow
Don't go till tomorrow

I want to laugh and dance in this romance
Forever in time

And I'll be loving you
All of my life through
And I will prove you
What love can do 
'cause it's true

I'm still lovin' you
Now and forever
Baby don't matter
All that you said
I'm still lovin' you

When I look behind my days
I see you smile for me
And emotions flow together through my veins
And my soul
And I wonder why you can
still make me feel this way
It's the very thought of you to keep my mind
Alone

Beating sky and sea my liberty
Will never be complete
Without your light in me
The shine to see
Every time I fall into your arms

In the morning when I wake
You're lying by my side
It's incredible to be so happy now
Alone

You can tell me what you want
I will believe you all
I still matter bout you baby
Don't you know
Alone

I've lost my heart awaiting for your love
Awaiting for your lovely kisses
Nobody give me your sensuality
Now and forever

Everyday you make me in extasy
Everyday you make me free
Tenderly, wonderfull, set me free

Wonderlover, angel of my heart
Sweet and lovely
Superlover reason of my life
Forever
Wonderlover, angel of my heart
Sweet and tender
Superlover queen and sensuality
Together

I've tried to search for other pretty girls
But now I'm slave of your desire
Nobody give me your sensuality
Tonight and ever

Walking on the street alone the night
Alone you fight around it
You can find all kind of music,

If you spend your time and look for fun
In every day and every night
You'll find it just for you boy,

Dancing faster, jumping higher
Shaking my mind
Always breaking down all the walls
Boogie boogie is always singing into my heart
I can find the reason to keep it out there

BAD BOY BOOGIE I can feel it beating on me tonite
And I can feel it stronger,
BAD BOY BOOGIE it can be the rhythm I want tonite
And it can be so magic

Gambling all the money that I have to realize
That is not true that boogie is what I want now,

When I feel the real thing I want to try to satisfy
My mind and leave behind my problems,

Call me baby I am ready
And excited for you my honey
And I see you like an angel
And I can't wait no more time babe

Waiting for your love
Waiting for your call
I'm in danger if you don't
love me till the end of days
Save me 'cause you know
Save me 'cause I need
I can't do nothing without you

Burning into your heart
Burning into your body
This is my desire, my love
Burning into your heart
Burning with desire
I want keep your love in my soul

Light my fire with desire
I'm your lover but I can't tell you
Now I feel you and my heartbeat's
Getting faster 'cause you are coming

I love (to) listen to you
But I just can't stand the nite alone so far
Staring inside
With my little heartbeat fading

Fly high
Could you believe in this easy reaction
Bright lights
And could you honey come back for your love

Can you hear me?
At the phone at this time
I need chances now
You'll be mine if you want
It's a shock for me
When you speak at the phone
Can you hold the line?
Just my eyes in your eyes I can't forget

No, I don't give it away
'Cause I'm not that stupid guy you know but now
Listen to me
I don't care (about) your little stories

I can do it for you baby tonight
That your love is not getting high
And move it
Dance dance baby take it funny all night
Because the way is not what you want

Got to remember

How I can forget
How many days in my mind how many games

And
How you can forget
How many kisses you gave you gave it all
For me

Can you know it, secret of the lover
Can you do it, do it for your power
Are you ready, ready like a rocket
Are you waiting, waiting for the starter

Every day you're joking, I just can believe it
Where you going with your little bag on
See the light you wanna see

Get your mind and WALK IN THE STREET
Baby Baby let me down

Have you took it all your preservation 
Do you want it, do you really want it
Do you check it, everybody check it

Lookin' for something new to do

I've never left you alone;
How many lies you could say
How many crimes you could do

How many tears I should cry

So babe don't you need me

Burning deeper into my veins

Don't stay in the dark
The night is on fire

I will never look back
'Cause my time here is up
And you're far away from home
She will never lose me
It's the beginning of the end

Finding a reason
Waiting for a miracle
Get up, rise up
And leave it all behind

I hope to see again the sunlight
It was hidden by my tears
Wanna believe and feeling all right
A dream surrounded by my tears

I will never come back
'Cause my home is unknown, so I'll travel
Around the world
You will not forget me
Just run away and take my hand

Everybody dancing got no other chances

And let your wings move me every place you need

You can't leave me standing another time
I Wanda fly, you're making me fly much higher
Fly away with me and forget the rest
In other words I give you my love

Slowly I run towards the light
Looking for what's behind
My imagination's full
Not knowing what I'll find

Destiny calls build up the walls
Don't wanna start to climb
Cause I am standing tall
I can see what I like

Crazy as it may be
Isn't it crazy
Gotta be wary
Got this thing inside of me
Pulling me to the core
And chilling me

Here I am finally I see the light
There's so much I have to do it's miracle days
Devil's dancing good I know way
Hold on with all you got
Here I am it's not the end of my life
There's too much I need to say
Don't give it away
Angel's singing my love is bringing
This is a brand new day

How could this be it happened to me
Time is still on my side
I've nowhere else to go
So I will still live my life

There is a place where I would like 
to find what I've lost 
and dream what I want
There is a chance that I could take 
running away from you

I feel ready to go and shine again
'cause I dont wanna' fight for you
I wanna' spend my time in a better way
running away from you

I would fly in the sky for a night or more
'cause I deserve to live my life
See what I want
Dream for a while
the freedom is in my heart

I would fly in the sky for a night or more
'cause I deserve to live my life
See what I want
Dream for a while
Feel what I need for my heart

I used to hunger for you touch 
and even for love for kissts and more
I used to rock you all night long
dreaming away with you

I feel ready to go and shine again
Cause I dont wanna fight for you
I wanna spend my time in a better way
Running away from you

I would fly in the sky for a night or more
'cause I deserve to live my life

I would fly in the sky for a night or more
'cause I deserve to live my life

Open your eyes
You know you can try

Turn off the light

No other man gives me happiness
You know I never will forget

I look around all over for you, boy!
Wondering if you know
How deep is my love, inside my heart
And how much I care
Even if you just left my way

A strong desire comes alive...
To forgive you for leaving my love last
time
I feel crazy for this but... can you believe!
What's the matter? I'm losing my reason!

I want you back boy! for ever
Don't go too far away, my lover

That life could be so hard
When sense is gone

You never can feel

And I remember I was just on my own
My best little dreams were based on you

How can I tell what I feel
Imagine
I'm shy and I hope it's real
All I can say is comin' out of my heart
Oh how can I say, oh now can I?

It's a dream, always a dream
Nobody else will know
But I feel something inside of me
Very hard to say

If you only feel the way I feel
Lovin' me baby is just fine
If you only feel the way to love
I will be not so far from here

Waiting tonight for a call
I'm missing
To hearing your voice on the phone

I'll be waiting for you boy
How deep is your love babe
Take me across the sky
Every night - every nice day

If everybody's just bringing down
When everything is too painful
We're gonna be there for another new round
Before the dark is on the way you show your

Love, you gotta win on the night
You gotta turn on the light it's not too late
To see the dawning of the day

And we'll be looking at the sun
And you'll be shining as you are
So we'll be together forever
No matter even if you're far
'Cause I'll be looking at the sun
Another day will pass me by
But in the confusion my vision
Is gonna take me to your light

If every minutes as long as a day
Is everyday getting longer
We're gonna be there to look out for a way
Because we know the way to see the ray of

Love...

I wanna go?
I'm gonna follow you
'Cause you belong to me
You will fall again in love
And you won't need to say goodbye

Shine one more time
And I'm sure you'll begin to feel my heart
Some kind of hot
Desire all around & round surrounds me

Love forever... till the end of time
'Cause I really wanna dream again
I'll be the sun
Shinin' for you, for this romantic story

Love forever... till the end of time
'Cause I really wanna dream again
I'll be the moon
Shinin' for you I'll be the angel for your heart

I wanna dream
I wanna carry on
Livin' for all your love
I won't need to hide my tears
'Cause I won't cry again for you

Wait now for a chance
It's your time, you have to break away
Don't you feel it, follow your heart
there's a message coming on its way

I know that many times you left me crying
Crying, trying, lying for you
And it's a miracle the way you treat me
feel me, hear me, come back to me

Maybe one day you'll leave me
understand that where you stand is where you can't see me
Tell me how much you need me
So tonight let's get together
crush me baby

Speak up while I'm here
You have many things you need to say
I am waiting, tell me your heart
All the feelings you have locked away

Come on baby look at me
Should I let you weep for long?
Wanna tell you how to win right now
Like no other

Come along... For a night... I want you!
Speed you up 'cause I get crazy...
Why... This emotion gets too hard to be controlled

Never let you go
This time I won't let you down
Never let you leave

Never let you go away
Won't let you leave
I'll never lose my burning desire

Do you wanna come tonight
I would like to watch your eyes
Could I show you how to get more love
And be my lover

Watching you this morning 
Everything is shining 
What a joy to have you 
By my side 

Turn your head and tell me 
"I just need to hold you" 
Let me see your loving 
In your eyes 

Eyes that give me passion now as they 
Call me thru the night 
Nite that till tomorrow shines in my heart 
Just to tell ya 

Nothing's gonna take my love from you babe 
Anything that matters now is today 
I would never let you go believe it 
I wanna take it and deceive it 

Nothing's gonna take my love from you now 
Nothing's gonna hide the moon of this nite 
I would never change my mind and leave you 
And nothing's gonna take my love from you 

Easy like a rainbow 
Stormy like a tiger 
That's our love and always 
I'll be there 

Make me feel another 
Treat me like a flower 
Get me to be stronger 
With your eyes

Had your love and threw it away
How you make me feel
If I had the chance I could save the day
And run away now

Steppin' out in fashion
Movin' out to wonderland
So I am looking out
Tonite I'm going out of my head

Lost in a world
Close to the edge of something new
Never can say goodbye
I try to reach the sky

Lost in a world
Close to the edge of something new
I never can say goodbye
No matter how hard I tried babe

Beautiful in every way
Stronger by the day
And here it comes
Like a tidal wave
Will run away now

I wonder if you know
How much I love you, man!
I wanna start to celebrate
Come on and leave your seat
And try to understand...
It's so exciting to take a rest

Wonderful night for you & me
Dreaming for happiness
Dancing again with you
Forget your business and hold me tight
Darling! rock me... like a little babe!

Ready to celebrate...forever
We can do ti! it's easy to play, my love
Ready to celebrate...together
Shake your body, follow the rhythm

I wanna stay with you
And walk about the town
We can relax and shoot the breeze
I like your paradise
I love the way you are
It's so romantic to see the moon!!

Tonight I'm gonna see the moon
And think about our married love
Painted love, beautiful forever
I hear you

The light of a better day
Will guide me to the fairytale
Where I can fly away from nowhere
Forever

Call me, I'll see you waiting
You whisper: Love me
But I'm so far from you now

Painted love
You're just a 
Painted love
And I'll be here for you
When you come alone
In a...

Painted love
Just a picture in my heart
But I know, someday
How to find my way
Painted love

Tonight I'm gonna see the sky
And thinking of the where to fly
I'll be there, I'll be there beside you
I hear you...

Love....Now I know feelings of love
Now I know how much was wrong
And I don't wanna be alone
With someone without feeling

Love....Without love I could be lost
And I'm sure I have to learn
That the false stories are wrong
I will try to get real love

This is love  I could never think was so
This is love  With no body I've felt in love
This is love  Nothing else can matter now
The nicest story I'm living

This love has more shine than the sun
It's so much stronger than a storm
And you can't never get it never
Can't you know I'm feeling

So....Now I'm glad the past is gone
When I thought I was more strong
Standing with lot of girls
Who gave me only things you know

Baby I still remember now
All the times, all the days that we spend together
And now I remember why
I've been staying with you for so long

So you lift my heart to stars
When I just rethink of your body, my baby
My heart isn't far for your love
And we'll be dancing

Dancing to the rhythm of loving
Now that everything isn't gone
Tell me that your heart is still flowing
That it's still waiting for me
(and it will be there for me)

Baby when you remember me little boy
I don't know if you think of my love
Are you still so tender then
I will let you come to my door

So you life my heart to stars
Now that I rethink of your body, my baby
I know you're not far for your love
And we'll be dancing

Give it up and remember
That your love is not just dreams
Baby let me tell you now
That whenever
You're in trouble I'll be there

So don't be afraid
Even when times get harder
I'll be the one to hold you
Takin' your hand
Even when hopes are over
I'll be the one to care for loving

OPEN YOUR EYES, set your feelings away
And don't waste my time just like before
OPEN YOUR EYES, try and live for today
Because life is short and life is yours

Call me now, don't surrender
'Cause your dreams are here to stay
Baby let me tell you now
There's no reasons
To give up when love is there

I'm gonna change my world
I wanna believe
I wanna declare my love boy
Don't wanna stay alone again
'Cause I'm in love
We're ready to fly together

Keep me in your dreams tonite

Every nite & day

Tell me the reason why
I cannot insist
How deep is my love oh baby
I don't believe in miracles
Take me away
Take all my life forever

When I think of the summer...
As I smile and wonder...
Try to imagine it...flowers of elegance
All around you is summer...

Maybe sail away across the ocean
Enjoy the feeling of the motion...
This is my dream come true
I'll make it possible
Now is the time for me to make my move

Laying on my boat as I sail away...
Waiting for the captain to bring me
champagne...
Maybe sail north, maybe west or south
No need to worry, just sail away...

As I look at the sunset
Pulling me like a magnet...
Try to imagine it...power is what you get
With no feeling of regret...

You're back on the street now
And you wanna find any place to hide away
Cos life has been changing you
In these crazy moments all is distant

You gotta make it you gotta change it
Get your feelings back together
It's mathematics a litte magic
Shows you what to do

Open your heart for another story
Don't say goodbye to a band new dawning
Always there's a new day
Never be sorry I'll be here to say
Open your heart for another story
Give it a try though your tears keep falling
And you will find a new way
Never be sorry I will be here to stay

You're leaving the chain gang
Now you're gonna walk on your own break away
Out there is a different view
But you must remember what can free you

You gotta make it you gotta change it
Get your feelings back together
It's systematic a kind of magic
Shows you what to do

She's got many friends
And she's really in love, boy
She would take your hand
And be the one for you

Doing magic with her passions
Changing her destiny
It's only in her eyes that you can see over the
rainbow

She's the one, who weaves a magic spell
She's the one, who dances on fire
She's the one, who finds a special place
And make a spell of love & desire

Don't you be afraid
You have only one life boy
Take it while you can
It feels so right for you

Say you'll never love me
If I'm not the only one
Say you're gonna leave me
When another man's around

Hold out a little love today
For me for the man I need
Trust me I wanna be the one
Cos you know

You gonna be my untouchable lover
Nobody else is here tonight
You gonna be my untoucable lover
I wanna hold you now and forever
You gonna be my untouchable lover
Nobody else is on my mind
You gotta be my untouchable lover

Rock me down to my soul
And I'm gonna feel so right

With you man, get ready!


I feel the light, where ever we go
Being together, walking around the world
You won't regret, you're not alone
Just give me one good reason


You really are the man I love
And I just want to be your girl
When you're feeling happy I know
I'll come back to you
You give me more then I dream


You really are the man I love
I just want to help you boy
And you wan't be sorry again
You belong to me
I want to hear you say "Girl I love you"


Boy you know I really love you
Right now you believe me
Don't you see the hurt in my heart
The power of lovin'

My baby may not be a wealthy man
But I know money can't buy everything
I'm not the kind of girl
To fall for diamonds and pearls

It's obly love that can buy my heart
Not even a real fancy car
Like some girls do big only money will do

Like by far what you can on getting
It never makes me feel like I do
Cause if it's not to love our money
I know we'll wanna never choose

(a)
 I don't need a sugar sugar daddy
 No amount of money can't buy my love
 I don't need a sugar sugar daddy
 Cause my baby's loving makes me eager to know

My baby may not feed me caviar
Or have a swimming pool near his backyard
But I love him so I want the world to know

Like by far what you can on getting
But never make me feel this way
Cause there's no something to choose for his love
There's nothing anyone can pay

(a)Repeat x3

Toy shops and all the shops to go
For all the money you have to spend
Means nothing to me
My baby's not yet big enough
But this love gives me all the riches
I could ever need

(a)Repeat

Once again tell me that you love me
I'm only dreamin'
Maybe I'm just wrong
Just a kiss, and I'm feelin' higher
Don't cheat me baby
Now and ever.

You take the chance with me,
you'd better think again
Don't you feel it
You take it wrong you see,
because you love me
Feel me.

To my love surrender
For feeling inside a brand new lover
To my dream surrender
The meaning is being mine forever.

To my love surrender
For feeling inside a brand new love
To my hopes surrender
The meaning is being mine forever.

Just tonight you will see me cryin'
I care for lovin'
Maybe it's the time
Just a smile, and I'm feelin' better
Don't leave me baby
Now or ever

Let's go crazy

The day you kissed me
That's when I knew that I loved you

I thought love was a fairy tale
With happy endings every time
But now you have gone away
And it's a rainy day

Now I know
Love can never be forever
Love is blind to the time we say
goodbye
Now I know
We will never be together

Love can make me feel

Last night you said you love me
But still you didn't touch me
Oh baby baby

Call me for a while
Only baby

Like a little girl until tomorrow
Tonight, I want you now

Looking for an answer
The night will tell me

The moon is out there
Up in the sky she's crying again
I'm giving all my heart now
I don't wanna be left without you

Taking my time to cast away my bad days
Future's in my hands I hold it now
And I see you

Shining like a lucky star
I believe my love is gonna be forever
I can see your light is growing bright
And I will sing for my baby
Shining like a lucky star
I believe this time we're gonna stay together
I can feel, your eyes into my soul
And we will grow in the sunshine

The sun is out there
Up in the sky he's dancing again
I'm living all my life now
Gonna find you again inside me

You killing me softly with your love
Don't you know my way
I need you and I miss you tonight
You will never be alone

Time goes by
And, of you, I got only one picture
Take me home
Take me into your world
Come on baby

Take me to heaven
And dancing forever
When the night takes me away
Take me to heaven
Your love is forever
Dancing in my dreams together

I'll show you the way to make it, love
Let me see your eyes
They want to see the best of me
Let me take you 'round the world

There's no escaping this time
Something has got to change
You never say what you want to say
Maybe it's time to say it

One more time you close the door
One more time can't take no more
This is the time to come together
Maybe it's time to say it now

Don't play with me 'cause you'll fall in love
It's just a dangerous game
Many times you have let me down
Over and over you just loose again

My telephone never rings maybe my numbers changed
A signal coming I feel it strong
This is the going crazy

Right now I wanna get out
'Cause I wanna share
This wonderful night with you
Hey boy, I'm ready to call
It's easy to say
I guess you will answer me...

Take your car again my love
Can you be faster? take your best way!
It's too late! no time to play!!!
Even the sun is rising up

Back to the night a crazy illusion
Ready to get on with this game!
Back to the night a new emotion
Follow my direction and be wild boy!

This time I wanna be sure
To rock you again
I wonder how long you take!
Hey man, I'm ready for you
I got what you like...
A beautiful dress tonight

Do you know now
What I want to do together?
In my hot dream
Wanna lie on the ground and
Kiss you till the mornin' one more time

I remember that
You were a child when I saw you first
(It) was a hot 'nd sunny day
You were a nice and smilin' babe

Tell me why you say: "Forget me!"
Gonna feel again like a ghost without you
Tell me why you want to leave me
Never again boy wanna hurt you
Tell me why you say it's over
Gonna feel again like a ghost! I miss you
Tell me why you want to leave me
Baby forgive me wanna love you...

Would you like, boy
To be close to me forever?
I'm not fool now
Life is gonna be fine and
I don't wanna lose you one more night

The planet of love
Is where we shall live
Together forever
Till the end of times
Up there in the sky
The kingdom of peace
As galactic lovers

Go straight to Jupiter
Not far from the moon
Not really so far from Mars
Reaching your heart and soul

This is my DISCOVERY
It's more than paradise
And where I want to be
Oh what a surprise
Together you and me
We'll never be alone and
We will be flying free
together

The planet of love
Is easy to find
It's where my lover
Wants to spend the time
Up there in the sky
The kingdom of joy
As galactic lovers

All I need is your love today
Please don't leave me alone this time
(It) would be good now to understand
(that)
My sweet loving's too far to end

This time I know it's for real
For you're standing up with me
Oh oh feeling
To look for desire
Stop it! that's what I
Wanted tonight

How deep is your love?
I got my heart on fire
We can spend the night
How deep is your love?
Just flying higher & higher
Baby like before!

Will you give me a chance tonight?
Please don't tell me you've got no time
(It) would be great now to realize
(You) stick with me, what a nice
surprise

This time...

I know that I was born with it
A small little bit gives you something special
Even if I just take a chance
It could all just work out fine

Somewhere way down where nobody konws
Comes rising up a song to sing
Totally true but it's up to me
To reach out for my destiny

I've got the music in my heart
Whenever the fire pushes me
It's a magical call I'm up when I fall
Wonderful what a song can bring

I've got the music in my heart
Whenever the fire pushes me
Only someone like you can see that I'm true
Knowing me just the way you do

The spirit of life can get you down
Just one little thing
Makes you wanna run away
I know that I can still go on
Believe in what you find

Good luck it's easy to tell you
Every time you walk out baby
Thank you I'm always around your heart
No need to tell me more

Let me be the one tomorrow
Tell me not to heal the sorrow
Cos' you want to stay this time
So why don't you tell me

I belong to you my love tonight
I believe in you to feel inside
Any day we're not together all
The passion on your heart oh baby
I belong to you my love tonight
I believe in you and feel so right
Any day we'll be together now
I tell you from the heart oh baby

Well done I see you later
And you play around forever
That's it I need you to be with me
Until the end of times

I believe that the place I belong to
Is the best my baby
It's a place where I can be happy
Where I can be dancin' I can be dancing now

This is what I can feel
Run away, turn away never from Japan
Easy to love I want
Just to play in the game forever

I don't wanna live in Brussels or in New York
I just wanna live in Tokyo
I don't wanna go to London or Africa
'Cause I'm really great in Tokyo!

I don't wanna live in Washington or in Spain
I just wanna live in Tokyo
I don't wanna go to Paris or Germany
'Cause I'm really great in Tokyo!


Let me stay never ask me to leave now

I'll be by my baby

If you are, if you'll be around me

When enjoying the sound then

We can be dancing now

I got something to tell you babe
Something precious regarding my love that I'm keeping inside
Like a breeze I just feel you boy
God only knows what's the matter, when I was changed

Wind of change	I'm ready
Wind of change	Don't you feel me love?
Wind of change	I want you
Wind of change

Oh baby the wind of change
I'm not alone, no more
I feel the wind of change
Forever we'll get ready
oh baby the wind of change
I'm not alone, no more
And now you can ise your hands
Forever baby now the wind of change

Lookin' up to the sky my love
Oh baby listen to me (I) got somethin' to give you
Just together, now we can fly
Free like a bird in the blue sky, crossin' the starlight

When in my life I remember you
Never in my mind
I have no more time
To blieve in you
Only for you, love

Ever and ever won't be mine cuz you don't feel
Forget me baby
I gotta have my reason
Why (do) I waste my time?

Unforgettable
Life is better
No way to have anytime this kind of love
Unforgettable
Missing you this time
Leave you forever
Why do you kill me

That is my life unforgettable
When I remember you
You in my life
I can't live like this
Wanna forget you

I can't be left alone now
The reason why I'm here...
I'm looking for a wild man
Don't wanna waste my time

No matter what they say
Wanna be kissed tonight
It's enough,
It's enough to be with him again
This is the man for me...baby

He's a maniac
This is ok! you know
If you want love you've got it
Maniac
This is the time to go
Looking for wild emotions

And I can feel the presence
Surrounding me again
You know I'm not so easy
I really need my man

I'm all alone
Stand by me now
Don't tell me that you love her
Look at me now
I'm running free
So baby drag me down

Make me feel like a woman baby
Make me feel everything you want to
Let me fly to the seventh heaven
Oh be mine, make love tonight

I-I-I
Nine and a half weeks
The time, time, time with you
I-I-I
Nine and a half weeks
I need to spend with you

I've never known
A boy like you
So pretty and yet so shy
But now I know
You understand
I want your love inside

It's been the longest time since
I have seen the light
And while I'm glad to be with you
I'm tired of the night

Would you agree with me tonight
That it's time to let me go
I'm ready now for so... much... more!

Goodbye everyone
I'm finally free again, for new adventures
My trials are done
This feeling across my mind, I'll always remember
Goodbye everyone
The sun in the summer sky will take me onward
My life has begun
To fall in my hands again, to horizons yet unknown!

My deepest gratitude for
Telling me you care
But now I'm off to better things
Although I don't know where...

Tonight I'll dream of you
And feel (that) your love is true
And in the dream my feelings will turn out to be right

What can I tell you now?
I always think of you
And I would like you to
Believe a woman in love

No more like before
Standing here and there of the wall
Oh please, no lies, please don't, my love

Now I see you, I open my eyes I'm a
Woman in love and I can't just see you
Try to feel now what I'm feelin'
Baby listen, no, don't let me down

I'm not a fool my love
And if you give me more
My hopes and dreams oh love will be again shining bright

How can I dream again?
How can I dream of you
I just would like you to
Believe a woman in love

Feelings of extacy
I'm going just for you
What do you think of me
So you can't leave me now
Coming inside of love
Running around the words
Sharning your deepest dreams
Spending your time with me

Step by step you talk my way
Standing like a fool on the line
Time by time your fantasy
So easy for you my love

You can do magic
Lucky lucky man for me
Don't stop to tyrn to tear me a part
You can do magic
Honey honey can't you see
Don't stop baby run with my heart

I feel you close inside
There's nowhere you can hide
If your love is strong enough
You will take me tonight
Beating of heart entrance
You take me to the dance
I'm your marionette
Have I convinced you yet

Final lap I'm on top of the world
And I will never rest for second again
One more time I have beaten them out
The scent of gasoline announces the end

They all said I'd best give it up
What a fool, to believe their lie-ie-ies!
Now they've fallen, I'm at the top
Are you ready now to die-ie-ie?

I came up from the bottom
And into the top
For the first time I feel alive
I can fly like an eagle
And strike like a hawk
Do you think you can survive... the top?

One more turn and I'll settle the score
A rubber fire screams into the night
Crash and burn is what you're gonna do
I am a master of the asphalt fight

They all said I'd best give it up
What a fool, to believe their lie-ie-ies!
Now they've fallen, I'm at the top
Are you ready now to die-ie-ie?

I came up from the bottom
And into the top
For the first time I feel alive!
I can fly like an eagle
And strike like a hawk
Do you think you can survive...
I came up from the bottom
And into the top
For the first time I feel alive!
I can fly like an eagle
And strike like a hawk
Do you think you can survive... the top?

Help me help me
Come on babe tell me
With your special lover
Baby understand

Set me free
Show me your desire
Never gonna leave me
Baby understand me

I'm ready for your passion
Take me now and don't control
Love is like a good vibration
I'm just waiting for your love...

Ready for love for love...
Babe bring me satisfaction
Ready for love, for love
Energy is my devotion
For your love...

Kiss me babe
Everytime I need you
Day by day I love you
Baby don't forget me

You are too lazy
You are my only fire
Please don't make me crazy
Baby understand me

Friday night
In the heaven I'm so right
Just a paradise no pain and no sorrow
The moon light fit to hold a baby tight
Tell the sweetest lies tonite and tomorrow

Live here is so easy
Shiny people by my side baby
Love will be so easy
And I know you'll say good-bye
We live in

Bora bora bora this magic wind

Bora bora bora the land dreaming to me

Bora bora bora the happinesse
Bora bora bora no loneliness
Bora bora bora you give your kisses to me

Drink so right
Cuba libre all the night
That's a paradise can't think about morrow
Future's bright
And the sun gives me the light
Come on baby move your body I will borrow

The darkness falls
There's no one in sight
From my window
These city streets
Are hiding from light
There's nowhere to go

We're on the edge
Of feeling the despair
I hear a voice
From beyond the atmosphere
Will the true unknown
Leave us so alone

When the sun goes down
Will you hear the cry
Or just walk on by
And leave without a sound
When the sun goes down
Tell me, will we live to tell
The mystery of midnight and spell
When the sun goes down

Those unafraid
Will make the escape
To safer places
But where it's cold
They freeze and they wait
For you to save them

I wanna burn
Burn a candle you can see
The kinda flame
I need you to believe
That the creatures of
The night will never leave

Oh babe
You say you love me true
And I say no "I love you"
So baby what can we do
To give all this lovin'

I won' t get anywhere
Without love, I wouldn' t care
So why don' t you come my way
And take me to heaven

People say that love is a taxi driver
Jump inside, easy come and go
Never ask the way, you come my way
But tonight why don't you open

Taxi taxi taxi driver
Open up your car and go (Gooooooo)
On a joyride to desire
Drive on a journey to heaven

Taxi taxi taxi driver
Open up your car and go
Riding through the streets of fire
Drive on a journey to heaven with me

Oh babe
Drive me back home to you
And don' t ask me if I do
Believe all the things I say
To catch your attention

Why don' t you take the wheel Of my love
and make me feel
We' re driving to somewhere new

I don't wanna say goodnight
Save the latest dance for me
Burn your leather on the floor
You can run but you can't hide

Little dancing queen you move
Will you please make a move for me
One more sight, it's allright
Cause I know you want me too
You'll be mine

Hey let's get it done tonight
We better take the chance in time
Out of sight
Like a night dream

Hey let's get it done tonight
Why we keep wasting time
It's a crime
I'm the right one for tonight

Skin tight ready for the ride
I don't need to know your name
You can lie 'cause I don't mind
Anything you say is fine

Every sexy move you make
You do one more move for me
One more sight that I like
Ain't no doubt you want me too
Mine all mine

I wanna feel that you'd be mine
Come and don't be shy
This night I'll take you to the top

Relax you mind and take the train

You can't refuse my touch because
You're turning on

Seal it, with a kiss, the lips are dreamin
Make it, there's nothing else you can do
Come on and test my

Bad love, all you need is something, doubt my
Bad love, all I wanna do is take my
Bad love, in the girl you cannot hide
Bad love, it's so big and wide my
Bad love, love to bend my life for

Don't wait too much, you'll miss the train
It wouldn't pass again
You can't refuse my love beacause
You falling on

Many many years from now
riding fast from town to town
desert land and wilding rivers too

There was a man, go hippy go!!
Just a man, go hippy go!
A bandit?? Ohh....A bandit?? Nooh!!!

Many many years away
but the legend keep the way
‘bout the man with his mantle... blue

He was riding in the wind
dusty dusty in the wind
A bandit?? Ohh....A bandit?? Ohh!!!

No No No
Cause his heart is full of passion
No No No
He’s a cavalier of love
Yeeah Yeeah Yeeah
with a tenderness emotion
he was looking for his love

Alamo Alamo
He was going to Alamo
He was thinking just to find his pretty love
Alamo Alamo
He was going to Alamo
He was looking for a neverending love
Alamo Alamo
He was going to Alamo
He was thinking just to find his pretty love
Alamo Alamo
He was going to Alamo
He was looking for a neverending love

Many many years from now
riding fast he reached the town
where he had to find the key of love

What incredible surprise
cause he found a war to fight
Oh bandit!!...Ohh bandit!! Ohh!!

So the story story goes
with the blood and with the soul
But the war will never stop the love

For a man from town to town
crossing rivers up and down
A bandit?? Ohh....A bandit?? Nooh!!!

Fire's on the moon
I'm waiting in my room
The bloody sky's on fire

No one knows the name
No time to run away
My fault is your desire

Aye - aye - aye!
Gimme me only a reason
To be over the war
We're gonna fight this

Bad world, bad world
No more satisfaction
Without love in the world
Bad world, bad world
I've got no reaction
In my heart in my soul

Fire's on the moon
I will not play the fool
Just like the stupid liar

I won't walk away
A never ending play
This power takes me higher

I would like to make a trip
Where I can feel the heat
A universe of story
There it's gonna be okay
To travel all the day
Catching the glory

This is where I long to be
A glamour mystery
The central land of asia
Where the people knows the way
Life doesn't turn away
And time is over

Land of love
Of magical magicians deep and glow
Where several religions doctrines and fashion
Are ruling that world

Oh China, lovely China
Gold and silver against misery
Oh China, wilding China
Yellow rivers and magical seas

Oh China, here the China
Where the sky seems to be painted blue
Oh china, funny China
Where a day I will be there with you

I would like to have a dream
A never ending dream
About your ancient story
Then to have a machine time
And running through the sea
Feeling the glory

Just a living answer
To the things you wanna feel
To believe that something's over
To believe that you can heal

Nothing 'but the glory
I can take it on my way
Just for livin', just for livin'
And i'll never be the same

And i'm gonna wipe your day
Surrounded by haze

I don't wanna break away

Fire in the night

Fire in the night, tonight
And you'll gonna get away in paradise

Just a blaze of glory
To reveal the who you are
To complete the perfect circle
To get into you so far

Nothing more to fear, to tear
To blame into your into
Just for given', just for given'
Run away and shoot your dart

'Cos i'm burning flame
And i'm gonna wipe your day
Surrounded by the haze
I'm dead on time

Fire in the night
Fire in the night...

Still willingful of waiting for you
Tell me, could this be love?

How will I know
Will my heart make me believe it so
Or do I have to trust in the way I feel
If I could read your mind

Live in the way I feel don't waste it
Life is a party, let's make it hot
Don't ever stop the music

Life is meant to be a big fun
Turn the volume up to hear
The music get loud

I feel it's true
That real love it's longer than life
But you don't understand I can't hide
The feeling I've inside

I'm so unsure
Is it the real love knocking at my door
Or is it the sound of my beating heart for you
Tell me, could this be love?

You are the one that I'm loving
The only one that I want
The one is able to make me feel like this

But when the sun up in the sky will set down
And when you'll feeling sad and blue don't wear a frown
'Cause I'll be standing at your side
Make you feeling that I love you 'cause you are

Adorable, adorable
Don't change your way to love me after all
I can die in your arms tonight
I can stop loving you

Adorable, adorable
Your love is rouring like a waterfall
I will dive in your arms tonight
No matter what you do

You are the one that I'm needing
The only one that I love
The only I feel really deep into my heart

I realize I did it again
I made you think that we are much more tha just friends
Instead I've only tricked your heart
I've got lost in the game

Oh baby baby can't you see that I'm not serious
'Cause I'm a fool in so many way
Nothing you can do or say
You're just a part of the game

I'm gonna make another
Crime of passion - Crime of passion
Just another broken heart
The mirror gives the same reflection
But I don't know whu you are

I'm gonna make another
Crime of passion - Crime of passion
Just a thrill over my skin
Same feeling of an old sensation
Pleasure mixed up with a sin

I realize I did it again
I'm not a hero I am not that innocent
Instead I've only tricked your heart
I've got lost in the game

Wishing well for you all I would like to tell the world a thing or two,
about all of you this I wanna do, with my music... oh oh oh...

And never again I will find in my life
other people who loves me like you have done
until right now, supported me on through a life time

"Big is your faith"... it's big like a mountain
"Big is your faith"... so big and I know it
Without a break... pushing me together
Heaven awaits... and I feel a saint in heaven

Let me tell you my friends I would like to fix the time and never loose,
all the memories, I'll remember you in my future... oh oh oh...

Don't hide or fight it girl
We feel it right along from the start
First kiss the tenderness
The heavy beating of the heart

The sudden ecstasy 
When your arms cling to mine
Now it's more than late
To deny our love is fate

Got to be your lover
you and me forever
We got enough love inside
Got to be your lover
Sharing love forever
On the wings of love we'll fly

Got to be your lover
So let's stay together
Love gives lovers every ride
Got to be your lover
Don't deny my offer
It's a case of do or die

Goodbye to former compromise
I found and I'm making you stay
One smile and suddenly I knew
Got lucky on a lucky day

The cruel ecstasy
To know that you are mine
And the feeling's great
so don't hesitate to say

Just you and me babe
Found you and I'll never let you go
Yeah you and me love
On the wings of love we'll fly

Maybe you say right or maybe wrong
Another love song make me strong
Seem to far away, the better days
Don't make me cry, don't say goodbye

But if your love can't take the changes
Maybe we can start again once again
All you have to do is say it
We can try

Listen to your heart don't say goodbye
Listen to your heart don't make me cry
Forever now
I need a little sunshine in my life

Listen to your heart don't say goodbye
Listen to your heart don't make me cry
Forever now
You're deep inside, in my heart
In my mind, all the time
Don't make me cry, don't say goodbye

Whatever you think that love's unkind
I'm gonna show you things to share
We can make it happen, just close your eyes
Don't make me cry, don't say goodbye

Baby - unforgettable
Baby - unbelieve
You are - always stuck in my mind

Tell me - that you're coming back
Tell me - that you want me again
My life - is unbearable
My nights - without your love and on my own

Baby I cannot go on tonight
Without your love and on my own
Baby I'll love you for ever ever ever ever

I wanna hold you my arms my baby girl, I love you - I love you
I wanna dream of me and you together, all night long - all night long

I wanna look into your eyes my baby girl, I love you - I love you
I wanna live this fantasy forever, all alone - all alone

Baby - come and save my soul
Baby - I cannot go on
You are - all I have ever known

Tell me - that you will forgive
Tell me - that you understand
My fault - it was just a game
My night - without your love and on my own

Tonight is a night, a night of fire baby
Looking for love you and me together
We can work it out, it's now or never baby
Burning burning love crazy

Your love is like a thunder
Booming inside booming inside
Tell me baby what I have to do
Ever forever I

Kiss and fight in the name of love
Please don't go we can live together
Take a chance on a broken heart
Ever forever I
Kiss and fight in the name of love
Please don't go we can live together
Take a chance on a broken heart
Ever forever I will

A sweet summer night a night on fire baby
Hunting for love you and me together
We can make a move it's now or never baby
Burning burning love crazy

I know, every time I say to myself
"Never falling in love again!"
Then I end up finding my tender heart
Deep into the grip of the pain.

One again say "bye bye" to my life in space
Cause I've met you, girl
But the situation's under control
Baby, baby this time I know

I just feel a little crush, a little crush
A little something in my mind
I just feel a little rush, but in my heart
I know it'll be all right
I just feel a little crush, A little crush
A little shadow by my side
I just feel a little rush, but in my mind
I know that everything's fine

I know, every time I made a mistake
I have lost a piece of my heart
But this time I know the rules of the game
And I'm strong enough to restart

Baby I don't want to miss a thing
I won't miss and smile
I don't want to fall asleep
Before you open your eyes

I'm gonna give you my life for a moment of your love
I feel your heart beating so close to me
I feel your heartbeat going on and on

I don't wanna me lonely
'Cause this emptiness just can kill me
No I don't wanna be lonely
I just want to fill up your heart

Baby I don't want to miss a thing
I won't miss and kiss
I just want to lose myself
Into the blue of your eyes

If you don't like to be alone
If you feel lonely more than ever
Just look into your heart
You can find the decision to starting over

And there's a lesson that I've learnt
The only truth among all lies
You better look for love
Following just your heart and not just your eyes

I know I won't give up
And no matter how much my eyes have cried
I'll always going on
'Cause I want a life that's worthy to live

I'm looking for love.- I'm looking for love
I'll never gonna stop the searching
'Cause I'm looking for love - I'm looking for love
And it will be tough 'Cause I'm too dreaming
Will be hard 'cause I'm so defensive

It's time to go now my dear friend
It's time for you to take your way
I'll keep you in my heart
Hoping that you will find the right love one day

You're not alright
You're so sad and lonely
'Cause night after night
You're the one and only
But feeling this way it wears you away
Come on! You must get up and get it

Don't let it go
And surrender to the gloom
You deserve a love that
Lasts forever
Lives forever

Never give up in the name of love
You won't give in, you'll never stop to fight
Someday your love will knock at your door
You must let him in 'cause he will be mister right

Never give up in the name of love
You won't give in, you'll never stop to fight
Someday your love will knock at your door
You must let him in 'cause he will be mister right

Just be OK
Don't be sad and lonely
'Cause I know today
You're the one and only
To get your own love pure like a dove
Come on! You must cheer up and get it

We're no strangers to love
You know the rules and so do I
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
You wouldn't get this from any other guy
I just wanna tell you now I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonan tell a lie and hurt you

We've know eachother for so long
Your heart's been aching
But you're to shy to say it
Inside we both know what's been going on
We know the game and we're gonna play it
And if you ask me how I'm feeling
Don't tell me you're too blind to see

Give you up, give you up
Give you up, give you up
Never gonna give
Never gonna give, give you up
Never gonna give
Never gonna give, give you up

I can't believe that I'm always here knocking at your door
I'm goin' crazy whenever I think of you

And everytime I see you again
I know my love will never end
'Cause you are deeply inside of me
Nothing cahn change the way that I feel

You are my sweetest pretty little girl
Oh darling don't forget to tell me
You love me pretty little girl
With you my heart has plenty of joy

Sharing the days and the night, the laugh and the pain with you
I'll give you my love without the fear of regrets

Don't you know you can change my days
You can take me power
Don't you know you can change my ways
I've an inside to discover

I can say to you a million things
Just to make you love me like a mad
But if you look inside my eyes
You can see that those will be only

Promises that I cannot keep
I can play the king but I'm a thief
All the promises that I made to you
Were all lies uh oh uh

Promises that today are gone
I've a fallen king so deeply lone
All the promises that I made to you
Were all lies uh oh uh

Don't you know you can straight me up
You can stop my fever
Don't you know you can stir me up
You can make me say "It's forever"

I ride into the dust
My guns is loaded with bullets made of blood
The sound of my shotgun
Is coming right from my direction
Makes you get in action.

Thisland of desperados
This nowhere land
No mercy for the loser
And tonite you lost look at me.

Yankee yankee damn yankee
I can make you see your shadow dancing
Yankee yankee damn yankee
Everybody wants me dead or alive.

My tears are made of rust
I know this place is called the broken heart
My life so wild and fast
Has took a terminal dilection
No more time for action

Don't give it up
Do what you wanna do
I never let you go tonight

I messed it up
I know I was a fool
But now it's gonna be all right

Without your love I'll be alone
Without your love I just can't live
You really got me right
Now listen to your heart

I was waiting for you
You were waiting for me
And you're driving me crazy
(And we're losing control)

I...
I'm losin' in the middle of the night
A mystic sensation shines and flies
But nothing is real in paradise

All about
You...
A magic emotion in my life
Love me tonight or leave me alone
Feel all my dreams, you'll be so fine

Fly away, this night's forever
Please remember, love together
Save me now, don't wipe away my tears

Follow my
Dream,
Love is around and inside of me
Take me so wild, I'm your diamond's queen
Tenderly hold me forever
Time is gonna change my life for you

Dream
Love is a magic part of me
Makin' me fly through the sound of wind
Suddenly we'll be together
Life is strange but
Set your heart to me

I... I... I...
I'm lookin' for something new in my life
A lovely reaction will be alive
But nothing is real in paradise

You keep on asking me
Why can't we be together
I keep saying
Won't you wait a while
What's all the hurry
I thought we had forever
I just need time
Till I can make up my mind

I'm not asking for
A love to last forever
I don't expect to get a guarantee
It's just that I believe
Lovers should stick together
I'm only saying
Won't you wait for me

I've got to be
Got to be certain
I've got to be sure
I've had my share of hearts broken
And I don't wanna take that anymore

I've got some friends who say
Boys are all the same
They're only looking out for
Just one thing
I'm only hoping that
You won't turn out like that
I need some time
Till I can make up my mind

Been hurt in love before
But I still come back for more
I was such a fool
I couldn't stop myself
If you believe in me
If you want our love to be
I know you'll wait for me

I've got to be
Got to be certain
I've got to be sure
I've had my share of hearts broken
And I don't wanna take that anymore

Tell me what you do?
Can I wait it so fine?
Together we can make, baby, hot love games
Just another day, can you feel my heart?
Let me be your lover tonight

Tell me tell me why your love is a game
Take my dreams, don't you forget my love and passion
Let me be your lover, show me the way
I want to make you mine baby

Let the music plays so high
Forever in my life
Yes, together dancin' all night long
And tell me what is love in your mind
I'm losing you tonight
I'll never lose you baby

Let the music plays on you now
Baby, it's so loud
Yes, forever let me in paradise
Let the music plays, let the music plays
Without control
Fly with me forever

Please me tell me why
You can make me so wild
Forever we can fly in this rainy day
Just another day, can you feel my heart?
Let me be your lover tonight

In my imagination
There is no complication
I dream about you all the time
In my mind, a celebration
The sweetest of sensation
Thinking you could be mine
In my imagination
There is no hesitation

To give you all my loving
If one day you would notice me
My heart is close to breaking
And I can't go on faking
The fantasy that you'll be mine

I'm dreaming
You fell in love with me
Like I'm in love with you
But dreaming's all I do
If only they'd come true

I should be so lucky

You're my lady, you're my inspiration
You're my passion

Boring week end, oh! God! I can't explain
There's no way out, nothing is new
I won't give up, i won't give up again
Exit white light exit the blues

And no one else is going to make me believe (it) will be no better
And lovin' nothing else is going to stop me tonight
So i'm about to bring

1 piece of the wild
Well let me add 1 piece of my heart
I feel i'm gonna need 1 piece of the action in
For the hot time i want to live

One more sad night i just don't wanna ride
I don't care of all what they say
I will be fine i will turn it to nice
You can be sure, no chance to fail.

Look at us today
Oh babe don't you think this is so
unbelievable

Don't know what to say
Together in this place that still is
unforgettable
Wherever you will fly
Whatever you'll decide
I wanna be right in your project now
Whenever you will leave

However you'll achieve
I won't care
Say you will you will take me
Say you will you'll protect me
As you feel we were made for
And it's real in my heart (oh oh ooh)

Crazy destine
It's almost seven years we met here
that's
Incredible
Babe say you will
Oh babe don't you feel to dare no
it's impossible

Everybody now can feel the power
Everybody's looking down the tower
To defeat the enemy and the liar
Not to live the scary nights on fire

Like a super fan
Yes I need to believe in heroes, man
It's my only chance
To unleash my power
Tonight

Let me run in the jungle of fire
Let me get all the spirits of fighters
In the burning town
Tonight I will survive
But I'll get a new destination

Let me run in the jungle of fire
Let me get all the spirits of fighters
In the burning town
Tonight I will survive
In the real jungle of town

We can feel the power of the daylight
Leading us to fight the super trouper
All the cities now could be in danger
But we are the best men in action

Lonely love - I lost the reason
Lonely game - I lost the freedom
No one else relight my fire
No one else will take me higher

You refused a sweetest lover
The only lover who can it be?!
And day by day it'll never be the same
Babe you're gonna be change all the game

Game
Game of love, it's gonna change
For you and for me, and no more pain
I could die without you, but don't stop the game
And it'll be the same
Game of love, it's gonna change
For you and for me, and no more pain
I could die without you, but don't stop the game
And it'll be the same

Lonely love - with no reaction
Lonely way - no satisfaction
No one else keep my desire
No one else relight the fire

Tell me how to feel the hit...in paradise or hell???
Don't be glower, be my lover "jingo jingo dance"

Play the beat and move your feet... a lovely lullaby
La la song - all nite long - and we can feel alright

Louder than gossips, hotter than fire

This is my time and I just can't stop
Right now
So believe the rumors

Listen to all these rumours
Things about all the sexy nights
that I'm living

Listen to all these rumours
I don't know why having good times
It's so easy

And making love
And dancing all around

We can play all the night together
I'm just waiting for you my baby
I'd be kissing your lips forever
You're the gas that I'm needing

Growing desire to be with you one more time

Dig deep in to find how to give me a start

Happy happy
Moving flexible
Live is exciting with dancing

Sweety rover... go on like that.
Only your hands on me
Only your step to me
Only you and I whatever it means

Love me love me tender
I want live a deathless life
You'll be my defender boy
You're my light and I'm your beam

Show your love open up your heart
Come to my world and I'll come to your
wonder, wonder

You treat me as a doll
You hurt my feelings and
You think this story's like a game
You show no sorrow
So who's to blame?

But when you're alone
Needing somebody by your side
You call my name because you know that I'll be always there
Always close to you

Every time you say I miss you
Every time you lie to me
I feel it deep in my heart
I'm the victim again
I'm the victim in pain
Because you play the game

I know that it's no fair
You hurt my feelings and
I'll be forgiving you once again
With all my sorrow
So who's to blame?

Standing in the dark
Waiting on my own
For your shadow to turn up again
No one's helping me
No one saw your face
I feel so alone in this world

I'm crying loud, but there's no sound
The rain is pouring on me, oh can't you see
I'm standing here calling for your name
But who is to blame?
If I can't give up on you, 'cause…

I will never stop of loving you
Will I see you again before tomorrow?
Time after time you're still into my heart
How can you forget
I’m keep on holding for you?

I will never stop of loving you
Will you reach me out to heal my sorrow?
Time after time you're still into my soul
How can you forget
I'm keep on holding on you?

Nothing's going right
I feel I am blind
Only pain and confusion for me
I won't see my friends
As they might be saying
I should give up with this love

Boom boom 'cos my heart is beating
Boom boom 'cos my life is rolling down
That's just because of you
'Cause you don't give me loving

Tic toc tic toc ready for the count down
Tic toc tic toc hunting you down
Tic toc tic toc 'cause I want you back now
Tic toc tic toc and I won't give up now

I am shooting an arrow to hit in your heart
I'm chasing after you
I won't wait till tomorrow to loose off my dart
This is the way I do

Hush hush I need to keep breathing
Hush hush I need to keep my control
That's just because of you
'Cause you just keep on moving

When I look at you
Coz I look at every move and every step you take
The things that you do
The things that you say around come right on time
and then

It's the way you live your life
Always ready to have fun
And the way you move around
You kill me!kill me!

When i look at you
I fell like I'd live forever
There is noting else I can do
So I put my hands together bady (watching you)

And all that you care
And all that you've never wanted even never felt
The rules that you brake
The roles that you play around will sign the ground
and then...

Baby baby I look for tenderness
Some sort of happiness just me and
you what else to do

But you, but you, but you,

Baby baby baby you're unpredictable
Not even thurstable crazy and wild a
bird in the sky

What I do
If I'm in love with you
Your pictures over my fridge

Say "I don't love you anymore"
because

You're the one that makes me cry
You're the one that say good-bye
You're the one that never wanted to
believe in love again

You're the one that made my days
You're the one I want to stay with
You're the one that was my dream but I
will never find it again

Baby baby I don't like loneliness
I feel the emptiness into my bed you
know it too

But you, but you, but you,

We're feeling emotions
And I'll never let you cry

Far from the light
We'll never get up till the night
Is rising again
Far from the light
A neverending dream far away

Yes, you know
Tonight I fall in love
The flame is burning deep in my heart

Now is time
To lose my mind
Far throughts inside
I watch the light
I'm feeling fine
Ready to discover

This strange world will collapse
When this kiss may become dust
(Now) I see the sun

Far from here
I can hear
Your voice inside of me
Open arms
To the sky
Ready to exist again

I'm all alone in the night, I'm on my way
I'm hot and ready to bite, I'm here to stay
It's in my nature to claim a nasty love
I feel it flow in my veins, I let it flow

And I don't blame you you're another poser
I just don't blame you if you wanna take your time
Bring it on! Bring it on!

Beating round 'n round, you waste my time
Don't you see you're fading out my beloved
Beating round 'n round between, beside
Do it now! Do it now for me!

I'm gripping pillow so tight, I'm in the bed
I need to have it tonight, Don't make me sad
Don't wanna beg you for love, It's what I say
I think you're missing the chance to run this race

Tonight
We will take yo right
The love is danger
A feeling so stranger

All right
The only delight
The sweetest cover in the night

Ecstasy
Play the game of the night
The love is full of desire
Fantasy
Is the rhythm of life
We can tell you why,
But don't forget this lesson...

A positive potion

A dream in your eyes
Walking around the city lights

Baby, do you understand me now
Sometimes I feel a little mad
Don'Â€Â™t you know that no-one alive
Can always be an angel
When things go wrong I seem to be bad

I'Â€Â™m just a soul who'Â™s intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

If I seem edgy, I want you to know
That I never mean to take it out on you
Life has it's problems and I get my share
And that'Â€Â™s one thing I never mean to do

'CÂ™ause I love you

And I've got thoughts like any other one
And sometimes I find myself, oh Lord, regretting
Some foolish thing, some foolish thing I've done

Deep in your eyes I see
You have just come for me

Are you the one with the key to my
heart?
Holding me in your arms
Are you the one with the key to my
heart?
I know you're makin' me spark, oh

Every sunrise I pray
That this one is to stay
Who is my destiny
Will I know if he comes to me
The way you take my hand and hold
And you give me kiss of gold
I've begun to feel it too
If you want my love, I should just
Give it to you

"You turn the key to my heart"

Memories or fantasy
Whatever you will bring to me
I've begun to feel it too
If you want my love, I should just
give it to you

"You turn the key"
"Baby... you turn the key"
"Turn... turn... the key"

All at once
You made me wonder so good
I refuse to your help
But baby you took me back

Tell me goodbye and set me free
Come on baby and shock me over
Down into the street you look at me now
Before my trip

Run and run
Can you give me away tonight
Get my brain, get it on my way
Run and fun
Never take me away tonight
Over and over again

Bang bang bang
In my paradise
You wanna stay around, you wanna stay tonight

Bang bang bang
Fire in the night
I wanna make you feel it now into the moonlight

Give me the night
Because I'm gonna fly
You take me up no more
I can move i

Give me the night
I never feel the shock
Give me the night control
When I'm movin'

Won't you lead my fantasy
If you remain with me tomorrow
Won't you miss your energy
Get right, it's OK
Can you feel all my days

I want you, I need you
Ah, ah, ah
Look in the wisdom the light of your heart
Ah, ah, ah
Go to everywhere, choose me anyway

Shaking the time
I wonder when you fly
Limit yourself - control
What you do it

Ready to start
And take me up one night
Shaking my heart to go
When you move it

And now my heartache is over
I got back my life, I pushed you aside
And now your cruel game is over
Now I know the kind you are

You kept all secret to play
Dirty and undercover
You wanted all the girls to
Cheat on me forever

Big bad and hot love
No more illusion
I just want to run all alone

Big bad and hot love
No hesitation
And tonight I'm on my own

Big bad and hot love
No more confusion
I'm not scared anymore to heart

Big bad and hot love
No hesitation
And tonight I'm on my own

And now my life's starting over
The last chain is broken I can fly
And now that my pain is over
I can tell you who you are

Take a risk on my love
You can straight up my life
Can't you see that my heart is like a waterfall, baby

'Cos I don't want to be
Just another shooting star
I'm reaching out to you
Lonely and confused
Whispering this song in your ears

Is dedicated to our love
It's in my voice for you to hear
The tender melodies of my lullaby
Will cherising you, and this song
It's dedicated to the
Days without your smile
To the nights dreaming of your kisses
But the melodies of my lullaby
Were cherising me, and this song
Is dedicated to you

Take a chance on my love
You can light up my life
Can't you see that I'm falling like a
Rolling stone, baby

Bring the passion to me
Give me love as this is just the last night together
Tell me lies and I shall believe
And no matter what I am gonna love you

Me and you a story together
Love and a passion that's stronger than ever
Me and you connected forever
Love that is deep and true


Falling free
'Cause the sky is passing over my soul tonight
Baby baby can't you see
I can fly high like I had never realize
Baby baby I am falling free
'Cause the sky is passing over my soul tonight
Baby baby can't you see
I can fly high like I had never realize
Baby baby I am falling free

Bring emotions to me
Feel the heat as this is just our heart together
Tell me lies and I shall believe
And no matter what I am goona love you

We have been together
Now you ask me to be just friends
It's like a fever

Now I can remember
All the love you made just for me
It was September

You do't care of my heart
In my sky you were a star
In this place I will die
While you say goodbye

Come ontake me home you
Heart of stone
Come on take me home I know
Now it's over
Come on take me home you
Heart of stone
It's hard to say hello to my love

I'm not a pretender
I'll be jealous of all the girls
I won't surrender

We'll be friends forever
And forever I will be sad
I lost my lover

Time is running away
Sliding fast every day
I've been waiting for you my love
But now, got better to do

Listen
Tic toc tic toc
My clock is tickling
And tic toc tic toc
I'm looking for a king
To take on take on
Take on my heart
I got no more time for you

I need a king of heart
'Cos I'm a queen without a throne
He can rule across my land
We can share together this wonderland

I need a king of heart
'Cos I can't make it on my own
He can take me by the hand
And my heart will be under his command
I need a king of heart

Life is fading away
Disappears day by day
I've been dreaming of you my love
But now, I think you're just a fool

You're gonna destroy my love
With your actions you destroy my heart
You give me always bad surprises
Tell me tell me why
You treat my feelings like a toy

Baby make up make up make up
Your mind's time to wake up
They gave us just one life to live
Baby love and love and love me
love is what is worthing
The most important thing to give

But you're
Killing my love and it will destroy me
But you're
Killing love my heart' s disappointing
I'll love you forever but please don' t say never
I'll keep your remember so deep in my heart
But you're
Killing my love and it will destroy me
But you're
Killing my live my heart's disappointing
A dream lasts forever if we dream together
I don't want to believe in love anymore

You're gonna destroy my life
I was thinking to become your wife
You give me million of your lies tell me tell me why
You think that love is not a joy

The land of the golden dreams
I've searched for the "Land of free"
I've traveled around the world
But what I've found is

Just more, more, power
In the hand of just few men
Claiming control over planet earth
Just human we're meant to be
Just one world for you and me then
They seem to forget
That life is all we got

I say

No wars, no destruction
No more killed in action
No bombs in the future
Freedom to love
This is the thing we need

No wars, no aggressions
We need more compassion
No tears in the future
Freedom to be
People who live together

The land of the human beings
I've searched for the land of trees
I've traveled to America
But what I've found is

Me...
In the middle of the street
I can find the hell in paradise
I don't wanna feel myself alone... on... on... on

You...
In the middle of the night
I can see your face, I see the eyes
I will catch you just before you're gone... on... on... on

Now, you can beat the future
Yo ucan see what this is all about
And you never feeld the same again...

'cause you're the king of the century
Never give up on love
The king of the century
Never give up on what you are

The king of the century
Never give up on love
The king of the century
Never give up on what you are, tonight!

You...
In the middle of nowhere
Can you tell me anyone's in there?
Would you make me love from night 'till dawn? On... on... on...

Something very physical
But nothing to call illogical
Something so much magical
For me but not you

But i won't give up, i don't give up
Untill you'll change your mind
No, i won't give up, never give up
I'm gonna take me all my time

Knock, knock, baby, please let me in
Open the doors to my desire
I wanna taste you, i wanna make you mine
Set the night on fire

Knock, knock, baby, please let me in
Open the doors to my desire
I wanna test you, i wanna cross the line

Nothing really criminal
But something so close to illegal
Nothing cold and cinical
For me but not you

Sometime I really don't care
Some feelings I cannot share
This loneliness filling up my soul

And I feel your presence everywhere
I open the door but you're not there
This love is a fire that is burning deeply inside me

Put this fire out baby baby
'Cause I'm full of doubts maybe maybe
Can't you feel that I'm calling you because I'm dying
Come to me and stop my crying

Mon amour
I love you baby I love you everyday
I want you baby I want you right away
Touch me I need to feel you close
I feel your power

Mon amour
I feel you baby I feel you in my veins
I need you baby I need you anyway
Kiss me and you will never loose
Never the love I feel
The only love I know
The only love worth it to grow

Sometime I feel really down
Sometime I can wear a frown
This sadness is filling up my heart

I'm not cool
Not the kind of girl just right for you... maybe
Give me the chance
To try to love a man

Tell me you didn't say you'll go way
Tell me that you care and you're gonna stay
Don't say no
Can't you see I'm down on my knees

My baby's gonna break my heart
I can't resist I will break down and cry
My baby's is gonna let me down
Don't leave me 'cause you know I can't survive

My baby's gonna break my heart
You disappear into this rainy day
My baby's gonna let me down
No matter what I do or what I say
My baby's gonna break my heart

I'm a fool
To believe that still I can keep you...baby
Too blind to see
Too weat to let it be

I'll give it up if the story goes down
I'll give it up if there's no tomorrow
I need your love your caress and your kiss
I want your sex I don't want your sorrow.

But the way I feel is to keep on telling you that is real
I'm in love with you uh-oh-uh-oh-uh.

Never forever I can tell is over
Never forever I will leave my lover
Don't give it up if the story goes down
Don't give it up making love untill this down
I wanna stay with you more and
more and again uh-oh-uh-oh-uh-oh.

I'll give it up if you lie to me
I'll give it up if you'll stop the fire
I need your love your caress and your smell
I'll never stop burning with desire.

Don't come and tell me your yesterday
Don't be afraid 'cause I know my way
Keep moving on
Our past is gone away, so faraway

I'm like a virgin in your hands
'Cause I forgot what I'd been had
Don't hold on to your days if sad and blue
'Cause to me you're just brand new

No matter what they tell me
No matter what they show me
My love is true and you love me too
My mind is set to stay with you

No matter what they give me
No matter what they send me
I trust in you and I know it's true
Your love is my dream come true

Don't come and give me sorrows and tears
Don't be afraid 'cause I don't have fears
Keep moving on
Bad days are gone away, so faraway

I'll go on and on
Dreaming of one kiss from you
Only one long and true
All over my body

Only love can make me feel this way
The sun shining on me every day
The look in your eyes promise me
I will get...

One kiss from you - suddenly
You give me power, love and hope
Anything that I know
One kiss from you - tenderly
I do not know what I would do
Without that kiss from you

I'll go on and on
Looking for one kiss goodnight
A kiss that lasts a life
All over my body

Dancing with you in the night
It's only a dream that I got
Girls are dancing all around you boy
You are the best of ever

Then you look at me a moment
Now I feel my life has meaning
You take me by the hand
Dragging me to dance with you

Para boy para boy
Extraordinary
Sexy toy for my joy
I know that I should
Get you to enjoy
My night para boy

Oh uh oh uh

Para boy para boy
Go for the glory
Handle me like a toy
I know you're just a
Playboy to enjoy
Your night with me
King of the queens
You para boy

Dance in the lights of the club
It's just a trip that I need
Love will run around you boy tonight
You make me hot like fever

I feel you so close to me
I hope you still think of me
Even I know you found another love

You took away my chance to
Be with you forever
To be your love and stay together
You gave away the precious love
That we had to somebody else
Oh baby I wanna tell you

Remember me
Remember everything we used to be
Can you feel my heart pounding, pounding
Will be forever, will you

Remember you, remember me
I remember everything we used to be
'Cause my blood is still pumping, pumping
Will be forever, will you remember me

I need you, but it's OK
I know that, I'll find my way
I will begin to find another love

You took away my chance to
Be with you forever
To be your love and stay together
You gave away the precious love
That we had to somebody else
Oh baby I wanna tell you

Remember me
Remember everything we used to be
Can you feel my heart pounding, pounding
Will be forever, will you
Remember you, remember me
I remember everything we used to be
'Cause my blood is still pumping, pumping
Will be forever, will you remember me

I feel you
Even I know

Be with you forever
To be your love and stay together
You gave away the precious love
That we had to somebody else
Oh baby I wanna tell you

Remember me
Can you feel my heart pounding, pounding
Remember you, remember me
'Cause my blood is still pumping, pumping
Will be forever, will you remember me

I'm all alone
Keep on trying to think what was so wrong
Keep on trying to analyze my love
Deep in my heart I can't cry and going on

Once in a life
You can meet a boy and feel him right
You can meet a boy that gives you a light
Once in a life he can makes you feeling fine

With you and me together
I can't say good-bye to you, you were my world
Baby you killed me in a moment with a knife
And a rose in your smile
Please

Save me babe I need you please
Save me now I don't believe you want to leave me alone
'Cos baby I can't survive you got to keep me alive
So baby save me I need your love
To keep my faith and be strong now
We can try again to get along
'Cos baby I can't survive please baby save me

I'm all alone
Keep on trying to think what was so strong
Keep on trying to calling back your love
Deep in my heart I can't cry and carry on

Once in a life 
There's a reason to get up and fight
There's a reason that can keeps you alive
Once in a life everything could be all right

Time is gonna change
But in my life I never lost control
I trust myself
I trust the rules
Time to make this miracle now

I got the power right in my hands to
Make my dreams become reality
Already did it, I got one love in my life

My king is
My king is you
Today I found a melody I can sing
You set me free
You set me free
Today I've found the right song for the king

My king is you
My king is you
Today I found a melody I can sing
You set me free
You set me free
I'll sing a song to you my king

I have never lied
And I feel free to say what I keep inside
A perfect world
Made out of peace
Time to make this miracle now

Wake up in the starlight, close to me
My heart is the amazing fantasy
Like living in a movie, I will be
A sunshine everytime

You are my story without the end
Just a night full of dreams no commotion
Life is free, stay with me
With my all desires

You take me over the skyline
You've got the feeling drive my heart everywhere
Forever again
Come on
I wanna be the only one

You take me over the skyline
I need to look into your eyes and find the way
I miss you again
Tonight
Please don't make me start to cry

You take me over the skyline

This time is so crazy, stay with me
Around my reflection, all my dreams
Just keep on moving, I will live
Without a lonely night

No, no control of my soul
You're really stuck inside my mind
No, i'm not ready to give up now

To find a way of reaching out for you
The only thing i can do
Ask to my mom, she's cunning and she's wise

She knows my secret

Oh ma ma, oh Mamma Mia
Let him know, sometime i'm shaking
Tell me how, oh Mamma Mia
'Cause my heart's about of breaking

Oh ma ma, Oh Mamma Mia
Let him know, how good's my loving
Tell me how, oh Mamma Mia
'Cause my heart's about exploding

No, no control, not at all
'Cause without you i won't survive
No, i don't want to be alone again

Don't kiss don't tell me
Lies I can discover
Don't hit don't hurt me
I just wanna make you mine
Don't poke don't touch me
I need to be respected
Give me your love
I'll give you mine

But you giving up on me
Each time I'm needing you
And if this is what you mean
I'd better say goodbye to you

This love
Is not the one I like
This love
Isn't the best I can find
Is this love
Is this that you want

Don't say don't yell it
Talk to me politely
Don't hide don't tease me
I just wanna feel you mine
Don't fake don't cheat o nme
I need to be protected
Give me your heart
I'll give you mine

I was so crazy about your loving for me
I couldn't sleep in the night from waiting
You coming to me
You knocking to my room's door

Don't try to say you need me don't say you do
There ain't no reason to stay together
Let's call it quit now
Cos both we know that it's through

Maybe now, maybe later, maybe the moment has gone

Give up on you
Give up on love
Cos I have been hurt in this way before
And I don't want, no more
To be the victim of love

Give up on you
Give up on love
Give up to feel like this and so
I don't believe that 
You need me
You trust me
You love me 
If you treat me the way that you do
Giving up on love

I was so crazy about your caring for me
I couldn't eat in the day from dreaming
You in my future
You in my life forever

Don't try to stop now to say what i feel
Cos all we had of good now has gone
Maybe it's my turn now
To knock the door of your soul

Take me higher
Enlight my body and my mind, you are the master
Teach me how to
Enjoy my life and spread the word around the world

Keeping the faith I want to
Immediately reach out a higher ground
Don't give up the faith, I need you
To reborn and cleanse up my soul

It seemed like a wonderlight
Just like a spark so bright
A trip to someplace too high
I could touch the sky with a glipmse of my eyes
I can't believe it

Fool desire
I can turn poison into medicine to heal you
Tell me how to
Enjoy my new life and bring my happiness to all

They've taken me away, they chained me as a slave
They locked me in a castle for the king

And now I strongly wait for you
I'm down into a secret room
And when I hear the gallop of your white horse
I'll know that you're here

You got me spellbound, I feel be witched
You got me so strong then I'll resist
You really got me in a fairy tale
And I won't break the spell

Into the secret cell into the coldest jail
To keep me warm I only dream of you

You can take me anywhere
Away from all this crazy world
I will go with you
Everywhere you go
Anytime you want me there
I'll be with you

I can feel you wanting me
I just can't turn away from you
You have what it takes and there's no mistake
You can fly
You can take me up so high

Drive away
Pull away
Just fly away from here
There's nobody to stop you now
I will stay
There's no way
I'll let you go from here
You and me
We're gonna drive all around and then
Ride away to the top of the heavens

All around we'll go
We can take it a little slow
We both need
All the time in the world
So just hold me hand and take my command, boy

All around we'll go
And this time I'll let you know that
I'll never let you go
Oh never, oh no, no, no

Now I found you
Won't you stay
Please stay with me don't go away
I will give to you
All the love you knew
I won't make you cry or say a hell lot of lies

Pull me close to you my love
I need to feel your skin on mine
Set your feelings free
That's alright with me
Just give in and be lost in this moment

Drive away
Pull away
Just fly away from here
There's nobody to stop you now
I will stay
There's no way
I'll let you go from here
You and me
We're gonna drive all around and then
Ride away to the top of the heavens

All around we'll go
We can take it a little slow
We both need
All the time in the world
So just hold me hand and take my command, boy

All around we'll go
And this time I'll let you know that
I'll never let you go
Oh never, oh no, no, no

I wanna stay with you tonight... forever
I love the nights when you decide... to stay with me

Despite I'm never honest with your heart
I see you don't surrender night by night
I really hope to change my way to love
I'll never wanna be your shame

I am a liar, I leave you babe
I'm gonna change to save our love
I will come back to you, my babe
Only when I'll belong to you

I am a liar, I miss you babe
I was a liar without control
Now I come back to you, forgive me
I'll never live without your fire

You want to stay with me tonight... my lover
I feel the heat of summer nights... when you're with me

There's a place to go
Where no man's ever gone before
A place where we can be alone
We can be ourselves
Be free forever

If you want to go
Just hold my hand and we will soar
Above the sky we'll fly so high
Coz you and me
Belong to be together

Up and away
I'll take you higher
Close your eyes
We're on our way
Don't let the clouds get in the way

We'll dance with all of the stars
As we go higher
You and I
We'll reach the top
Together we will zoom away
To heaven

And when you need to go
And find a place you can stay
Where you can ne who you are
You just call me
I'll be around for you

It's not impossible
Yes we can disappear from here
Oh it's my dream to have you near
Let me sweep your feet off the ground

Please let me take you way above the sky
Far away
You will be there someday
If you let me I'll take you now

And when you feel it's time
That we should fly up so high
Just close your eyes and say
Let's go and touch the moon today

Don't you understand I wanna leave tomorrow?
Because I wanna reach for you
Just to feel your hands... You're gonna need a chance on you
I want you by my side

Night and day
Be my only way not to be alone every time
I will say "baby, oh come into my arms"
Oh baby, now make a choice

I believe in miracle
I believe in destiny
I feel like in heaven like never before
I believe in miracle
I believe in fantasy
I'm gonna give you...
I'm gonna give you my life

You can be my friend, my love and satisfaction
You are the spirit of my heart
Why don't you understand?
I wanna live with you again
Together we can try

Dream of all my dreams
Nothing can take away your smile
Nothing can change my love for you
Burnin' inside, forever shine

Baby now
All the best things in my life
Will never do
In my soul
I got no control over what I feel for you

Shine forever
You're like a diamond in my heart
Even the darkest night
Will surrender to your light
Shine forever
You love's so precious in my life
I'll never be the one
Cloudin' up your sunny sky
Shine forever

Thrill me up again
I know I'm easy to destroy
I know you'll never be so blind
To let me down, forever shine

Can you tell me a reason why
Close to you I feel so fine
Every night, every day, say goodbye
To the night, my lonely guy

Come back to my heartbeat step by step
I don't wanna lose you, babe
You never and never leave me
Baby, you treat me right

Good time, we'll have a good time
And never you forget my heart
Together in the rising sun
Have a good time, now

If you want me, take a chance
All I want is my romance
In your hands, in your eyes, tell me why
In the future, no more lies

Open your mind on my destiny 
Love me forever with fantasy 

Only you can save my bleeding heart 
You won't let me die 
'Cause I feel the night, a lullaby 
Takes me forever wherever you wish to see me 

(I'll) never leave you alone, my babe 
'Cause we fell in love, uoh uoh 
Freshness in my dream forever 
Making you free my lips 

(I'll) never leave you alone, my babe 
Hold me up so long, uoh uoh 
Spending night by night together 
Never let you die 

Lay on my shoulder you smiling face 
Don't you understand all my lyrics tales

Baby you drive me crazy

Honey moon, you make me right
We can fly around the stars
Around the sky

Another passion like a fire
Like a beautiful night
So nice and fine
Another passion sweet desire
Like a romance with you and me
Another passion like a fire
Like a wonderful world
Across the sky
Another passion sweet desire
Precious angel

Neverlasting love and passion

With you fever deep inside my soul
(In my soul)

Come to me

Until the morning light

What's the babe I find now
Believe me when I will say
You'll be the mirror of the sky

In the mirror of the life
We can live together
Won't you see and change my destiny
Now and forever
In the mirror of the life
Keep the love together
Closer to my heart you, number one
Over and over

Imagine me tonight

C'mon let's do it forever
Tonight we'll gonna be alright

Ever and ever together forever

Never and never always together
I wanna hold you all the time

'Cause my love on fire don't wanna

Dream over your emotion
Feel over, my dream flight
Let's think about my love now
Grows into my heart

In deep of you I'm sighting
One man, I need to be
The real girl who'd like now
Dark and light I see

Filling up, my celebration
Cover up, my endless love
Hearing up, an old confession
Dreaming of a sweet comfort

Money cannot buy my love
Only you lose my control
In the moonlight make me feel your touch
The rainfall has gone by

Money cannot buy my love
If you leave my heart alone
Baby, baby don't you understand now
You'll be mine today and forever

Dream over my sensation
Feel over my beam face
Let's talk about us baby
Come into my heart

Let me dream of you just tonight
Don't give up, I'm gonna hold you tight
I could be forever your sweet temptation
Sugar baby love

Think of us together one day
Tell me why my dream should fade and die
Can't you see my love just brings me so down

I remember on that summer night
I will never let you go
Please believe me, don't forget me
I just need to let you know

I'm a bad girl
Give me your word
For your love
What's due for a fall

Won't you keep me waiting so long
Don't give up you make me feel alive
I would like to kindle your secret fire
Sugar baby love

It won't happen never again
Tell me why you never stop pretending
Can't you see my love is so strong, baby tonight

Everybody need a lover
And need a lover to dream
You got to move step by step
And don't breakdown
Have hope and you will see

Don't stop, don't stop
When everybody are cold inside
Don't leave the game
Try it, again
Remember, be alone without love is a shame

I GOT TO FEEL YOUR LOVE oh baby
Feeling your love inside me
Got to be
I GOT TO FEEL YOUR LOVE oh baby
When I'll feel a big love
It'll just stop me from crying

Everybody live for work and
They think love don't exists
I know I got to move up to research love
And deny my dream

Layin' on me, the night is on you, babe
In your eyes I feel another day
Won't you hear a melody just here in deep of you

I want you keep on running up and over the blue
I need to feel you're ready, day by day
You're gonna get me lazy, boy, I only want you
Along my little baby
Alone you drive me crazy

You play a wonderful game on the road again
You come on baby, you know I was a dreamer
You play a wonderful game, never set me free
Uoh-oh-oh-oh, get satisfy

Lonely nights, remember, little babe
Three four five, the numbers of my lovin'
Carry on the game you know until the night is cool

I got the blues so tell me babe
Sometimes it's hard to hide it well
Now I'll let you know why I was sad
and blue sad and blue

How do you know the way I am
You look inside my heart
Everytime you make me feel this way
We can say goodbye paradise

And remember baby you're so crazy
But I feel you're mine
Don't say maybe I'm your lady
Please don't change your mind
(never)

Eternity oh oh oh
I believe in our love I will never let go
for
Eternity oh oh oh
Only you in my eyes I will never deny
It's for....

I used to be so wild and free
But now with you I long to be
In your arms I feel alive
I close my eyes touch the sky

Babe if you read my mind you'll see
There is no mystery
Everytime you're kissing me this way
I can't say goodbye it's paradise !!!

I can't stop loving you
I got a feeling while
You're moving your body now

I can't stop dreaming you
When I'm alone tonight
I'm waiting for lovely sight

You make me losing my mind
And always spending my time
I lose control and you make me crazy
You really deep in my life
Your body rhythm is right forever

Let's go little baby
Let's go shake your hands
Dance dance dance
Forget your pains

Let's go be ready
Let's go take the chance
Dance dance dance
And reach the end

I can't stay without you
Time after time your love
Is growing inside my mind

Praying all the time
That you come back
My love is waiting for your delight

Dancing together takes me higher
Caught in a moment sounding good in our lives
Searching for love we can surrender
Our spirits burning like a fire on ice

I see you face to face
Waiting for you to turn the charm on life
I need you here tonight
Please boy be mine

Loving honey
Emotions now are flooding let it go
Hold me baby for a while
Loving honey
Stay here don't you worry let me go
Never mind about my love

I know there's magic when you're near me
Jumping right in and falling into your eyes
Tell me that we can work it out babe
Everything's right for me and you tonight

If love is danger
Then tell me why
If love is danger
Tell me why I feel so high
When you come near - baby
My heart just beats - crazy
Feet don't touch the ground
You turn me upside

Down in your kisses
Warning flash of light
Your warm embrace
Serpents in the night - baby
Your lips are burning
Something in your eyes
Magic poison
Don't let me die tonight

People say love is danger
I want to die of your love again, abby
People say love is danger
Then I'll fly
And I'll die
In your eyes

If love is danger
Then tell me why
A perfect stranger
Speeds my mind into the sky
I feel so hot, baby
You make me go crazy
My head's spinning 'round
Dance to the speed of

Sound in your kisses...

Hey man I'm a female
And anybody can see that my love is danger
Hey man I'm a teen-age I am
But I'm not scared of your age of your heart so stronger

Listen to my desire I need by my side
I need a man be my love
Got to put out my fire and you can't deny
I got something to discover

Love me stupid
I am alone and I wanna someone to give all my passion
Love me stupid 
I am alone and I wanna someone to give my affection now

Hey man I'm a female
and anybody can see that my love is danger
Hey man I'm a teen-age I am
But I'm not scared of your name of your life so danger

Coming out of nowhere
Like a rocket in the sky
I want to see if the game is over
Doctor help me get it right

I wake up, I've been in the power zone
You know what, they're living me here alone
Hurry up, I'm losing my self control
Big surprise, and in the night I'm flying high

High...
I'm riding in the sky, did I lose my mind?
I'm living in the future, flying high (don't know why)
I'm riding in the sky, did I lose my mind?
I'm holding back the future

1000 stars are over
One can be my guiding light
I want to see if I'm going lower
As I fall into the night

When the night is over
When the party is over
Leave it up to fate no matter what you do
Monday I surrender
Tuesday be your lover
I don't wanna listen to the reason why

Now I've got to fight for another life
Fight for my life
Bad I'm feeling had
When you're close you take my breath away

Run run getaway baby
You'd better run run getaway baby now
You gotta run run getaway baby
Keep running catching your desire
Reaching for another man

Everyday you take in
Everytime you're fooling
Stop me if you can I put the blame on you
I don't feel emotion
Never die for passion
You don't have to tell me cause you've lost my heart

There is a way we can be together
There is a way we can love each other
You've got the power to move my body
Tell me tell me now

You live a love alone
Sweety doll
You light a lonely gun
Funny dame
A feeling files on you
Show me how the dreams come true
Just for you and me

Your candy lady I'll be forever

Sometimes it gets so hard, I know where beauty lives
Life is a mystery, the night is cold for me
Listen to the sound of the falling rain, I can find so much to do.

Can you hear me screaming, don't you hear me calling
'cos I'm burning up, burning up for you.

Love, light up my fire in the night and making everything alright
Giving the chance to make you see the way to hold me.

Ready for your love

Deep in to your eyes, is like a thunder
Move your time my heart is burning

Give me your love and your passion baby

You say that love is not possession
You say that love needs fantasy
You say we must give it devotion
...But baby you don't say... you love me

Sometimes I wonder what I'm doing
Sometimes I'm cold and serious
But when you touch my body and close your eyes
Oh baby I'm sorry, I don't realize...

If you can't say goodbye
Tell me baby why (baby tell me why)
You don't wanna love me
Just like I do (as like I do)
You can't... say goodbye
Tell me what I've got to do... (I have to do?)

You know that I can't keep the distance
You know that I can't let you free
I know you like to give resistance
But baby I don't know if you love me

Sometimes I wonder why I love you
Sometimes I think you are dangerous
But when you touch my body and close your eyes
Oh baby... I'm sorry... I don't realize...

If you can't say goodbye...

Nothing to lose
One only night into the groove
I'm taking, I'm shaking
The ring of the power
Fingers, don't touch
I keep the run into the blue
Around you, without you
You take me higher

Killing down the noise
I wanna listen to your beat
I'm fooling with my ruling
Killing down the night

And dance 'n' can I forget you?

Chat on the wire
Turning the light
Because I wanna be the dark
You light me and shake
Go over and over

Don't tell me stories, babe
You must be lieing

And just imagine the way I'm feelin'

Some new emotions, some new sensations

Another woman, a brand new love to me

Through the night

On a day
Like today
All my memories are close to get fading
All my hopes and my dreams of love
Are just flyin' like a butterfly
Flyin' away

Everyday in my mind
There's a part of my dreams that's plain' around
More and more is playin' with my soul
And a sense of revenge
Is driving me mad

Cooling my desire, blowing all around
That's all I'm longin' to go for, better
Freezin' down my fire only for a while
There's nothing else I can do to love you

On your face
There's a smile
And your happyness is far to get closer
All the tears that I shed for you
Are just memories, a melody
Flyin' away

Everynight in my mind
There's a part of my dreams that's plain' around
More and more is playin' with my soul
And a sense of revenge
Is driving me mad

Down to the Merry-Go-Round
Wanna freak out
Feel like a star!
Time for a ride, time for a dream
Turnin' around and 'round you

Love is gleaming again for you
Everyday every night lighting me up
I'm just crawing for you
I feel every part, every beat of your soul tonight

Don't you want my heart 'cause I fall in love
I've been waiting for... Looking for you, sweetheart!
Don't you wanna kiss me tonight and be mine
Ready, steady go! Far away side by side

Don't you want my heart 'cause I fall in love
I've been shining for... Waiting for you, sweet love
Do you wanna stay for a while and be mine
Ready, steady go! Far away up in the sunshine

Time to get out for a spin, man
Down to the town
Just you and me
Love is away, come for a while
I wanna shake your blue heart

I can feel it tonight
(You) Don't remember the time
That we passed everynight

I'm a fool - hardy girl
Take it easy for you
There's a part of my love

Everytime this love it's so special for me

The stars in the sky wanna know
The little secret, baby
That is lying inside a romance

Ready to dance I wanna move around
Watching people so happy flying away
Ready to dance my heart is jumping down
To the floor of a night in the disco
Ready to dance I wanna move around
Cos I'm feeling so lively, dreaming tonight
Longing to saty until the morning comes
And my friends all around in their right time
(We are) ready to dance

Friday night what a night
I'm ready for you, wonderful, by my side
Don't you stop the music now keep it up
Cos your heart is gonna be part of me tonight

Precious experience... but is real!

Get into the music get in the beat
(I've got) something to say, rhythmysticality

(To) get into the groove you don't need the speed
Rhythm's just inside of you

First you need a drum and bass
A funny phrase
(You've) got to enjoy yourself
Add a bit of romance, energy just to dance
Take a good melody, catchy but hard to sing
Some crazy words
A password for dancing / for crazy people

Rhythmysticalitycious (I've) got to be strong
But the singer tonight
Makes me fly on a good refrain
Rhythmysticalitycious into my veins
Beating inside my brain

Rhythmysticalitycious (I've) got to hold on
And the singer tonight
Gives me more: a good refrain
Rhythmysticalitycious into my veins
Baby come on, this is the best refrain

Give-up to the rhythm, give-up to me
Something to play Rhythmysticality
(To) get into the rhythm no need no speed
(The) groove is just inside of me

Deep inside my heart... rhythmysticalitycious
Babe tonight take my hand
You can fly
This is the best refrain!!!

Breaking through the degradation
All this hate I feel around me

No one like you baby has got
Something special to reach my emotions

Lyrics ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires
Will come to you

If your heart is in your dreams
No request is to extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do

Fate is kind
She brings to those who love
The sweet fullfillment of their secret longing
Like a boat out of the blue
Fate steps in and see's you through

When somebody loved me
Everything was beautiful
Every hour we spent together
Lives within my heart

And when she was sad
I was there to dry her tears
And when she was happy
So was I
When she loved me

Through the summer
And the fall
We had each other
That was all
Just she and I together
Like it was meant to be

And when she was lonely
I was there to comfort her
And I knew
That she loved me

So the years went by
I stayed the same
But she began to drift away
I was left alone

Still I waited for the day
When she'd say I will always
Love you

Lonely and forgotten
Never thought she'd look my way
And she smiled at me and held me
Just like she used to do
Like she loved me
When she loved me

When somebody loved me
Everything was beautiful
Every hour we spent together
Lives withint my heart
When she loved me

I love you honey, don't hesitate
Oh baby take me and kiss me tonight
Please baby don't go
I need you baby and I beleive in your love

You are the best, you are my love
You take my breath away everyday
Open your heart
And give me all your love tonight

I will be happy with you, because I'm crazy for you
I am really crazy, (you) know me baby now 
I fall in love everynight
And don't forget it, I love you
And I love the way you are

You set my heart on fire baby, yeah!
I'm ready for you lover boy
So let my dreams come true
You can set my feelings free
I wanna be your crazy love
I wanna change my dream for all your love tonight

I'm gonna get you, get you my honey
Oh baby please don't say I'm a crazy girl
'Cause I'm in love
I wanna be with you tonight

I will be happy with you...

You set my heart on fire baby, yeah!
I'm ready for you lover boy
So let my dreams come true
You can set my feelings free
I wanna be your crazy love
Yeah yeah...
You make me singing yeah yeah yeah...

I'm ready for you lover boy
So let my dreams come true
You can set my feelings free
I wanna be your crazy love
Change my dream for all your love tonight

Let me dream about you my love
I wanna spend my life with you
Because I'm ready
Let me get you again, for this love
It drives me so crazy for you, just for you...

Dancing around the world with you
We can be one together we'll be stars
And shining into the sky
We'll wait for the new day
Nothing is moving

I'm losing my mind
When I can look into your eyes
You light my fire
Don't leave me alone so long
I cannot wait so much my baby...

Dancing around the world
I just wanna take you away, my love and I'll
Show you the way to the sky
We can be the joy when the music comes tonight

Waiting for you my love tonight
Knock at my door
And nothing matters
We are going to turn it on
We'll light up this fire everything's burning

Think of a wonderful thought
Any merry little thought
Think of Christmas, think of snow
Think of sleigh, bells, and off you go
Like reindeer in the sky
You can fly! You can fly! You can fly!

Think of the happiest things
It's the same as having wings
Take the path that moonbeams make
If the moon is still awake
You'll see her wink her eye
You can fly! You can fly! You can fly!

Up you go with a heigh and ho
To the stars beyond the blue
There's a Neverland waiting for you
Where all your happy dreams come true
Every dreams that you dream will come true

When there's a smile in your heart
There's no better time to start
Think of all the joy you'll find
When you leave the world behind
And bid your cares good-bye
You can fly! You can fly! You can fly!

Call me baby
I wanna talk to you
And I just wanna kiss your lips
Sweet like a candy
I cannot resist you

Hey
Don't you know
When I see your body
Moving like a wave
It gets me crazy baby
I gotta find a way to tell you

Screaming for love
Will you dance my song?
Taking me more
Just move and dance on
Screaming for love
Shall we dance forever?
Crazy for you
Hear me screaming

Listen honey
I wanna stay with you
'Cause I don't wanna dance alone
Feel like a woman
I cannot resist you

Have you ever seen the sky
Shine and brighten as your deep blue eyes
When I spend my lovely time with you
Everything is gonna be alright

Night and day you and I
Only you baby take me over, now take me over
Boy kiss me again touch me again
You can't stop loving me this night, all th etime

Chilly Boy Chilly Boy
What a wonderful toy
I will be your lover, you will be my love
Chilly Boy Chilly Boy
What a beautiful day

Now you've broken all my heart 
And this love will never be apart
Only you can make me feel this way
Without you it'd never be the same

There was a time for love

Dirty job but has to be done
You make a desert around your heart
Always looking for a fight

Every step I can take
Every movement I make

In the middle of nowhere
Like a stranger in the heart of the night
Shade of blue shinin' in the light
I don't wanna waste the time of my life

Who are you to play maybe
Takin' up my energy
What you do to your baby
Wastin' all away?

And the world would fall apart in my mind
Can't you see we can make it bright
I don't wanna lose the faith in you now

Never knew forever
Time was always by my side
We danced the night together
Now I've found my baby
Say that you won't walk on by

Can taste of love come from my heart
I get emotional
Your love is all over me
Your sweet & tender lies
And I surrender all my heart
I get so physical
Your power's all over me

No secret now
Tell me the truth, I won't cry
All my hope is gone
You're the one I have to leave alone

The letters dance before my eyes
The numbers seem to leave my mind
I walk above the ground, I'm feelin' special now

And even if the sun don't shine above
And even if the rain is fallin'
Down upon my soul
I wanna see you and ask for more

Memories & feelings
Happiness & dreams

I know memories & feelings
Everlasting healin'

Been waiting for an angel light
Been walkin' thru the darkest night
But then again I was livin' without you boy

Spend the night on a ride
I’m dreaming of a life in two
This time is you
Got to see you mine
No other girl is on tonight

My life is a fantasy come true
And all that you see is blue
You know that I get on you, with you
And then you take on my side

‘Cause I believe in stars into the sky
Just like one life one destiny
And I can see you flashing to the sun
Until my life is full

‘Cause I believe in stars into the sky
Just like a book full of memories of you
And all I need is coming right on time
And play one life one destiny
One destiny

When you stand on a line
You are waiting for a change of mind
To get it right
Got to make you mine
I wanna take you by surprise

Nobody else make me feel the way you do
Oh-ho-ho
Nobody else gets me closer to the moon
Oh-oh-ho

Come follow me
You better don't look back
We'll runaway to places that I know
Don't wanna stop until we're dead
Do anything to turn me on
Slip the key in the ignition

Dangerous speed cars
I'm in a mission
I got to moving fast
Feel the ride, the rush
The way I tease the clutch
Dangerous speed cars
Are like my woman
With curves like jaguar
And the way you purr at me 
Give me the speed 

Nobody inspires me better than you do
Oh-ho-ho
Nobody else is as special as are you
Oh-oh-oh

Born to be an angel
You will never surrender, surrender
Love the only passion,
Only you make me wonder
Oh lovely heart

Just you can drive me crazy
And I can scream hot love and pain, ayi ayi
Babe relight my fire

Sky high
Not a truth, not a dream, it's so real
Like a dangerous light, a blue
Sky high
It's a fantasy flgiht, now and ever
In my love, in my heart, in my mind
Sky high

Born to be an angel
You will never surrender, surrender
And your love so tender
Only you make me wonder
My lovely heart

Walking down the street tonight
Walk on by you are my delight
Keep in touch and rock this way
I have a thousand miles to race

Prasing life
My story is flowing in danger, it's a great
New opportunity tell me dear
If you wanna feel the heat on me

Keeper of desire
Whatever it takes to go into overdrive
Breaker of time
I'm riding the planet, destination unknown
I'm your keeper of desire
Whatever it takes to go into overdrive
Shiver of surprise
One way to trip to relive, here we go!

Constellations never seen
Shake my hand we start to creep
From the heaven to a star
Lock me baby in your heart

Scream & shout
The killer of the nightmare
When I get up I say hello

Black the night
Is sitting in the highway
Until the race is over

If you just want
To spin me around to steal my identity you are wrong
Because nobody can survive
Chasing my double pedal stroke

I feel power and glory
Your leader on the road is back
Westside is burning
Go demon with the blades on tires

I feel power and glory
Your leader on the road is back
Twister is coming
The hero with a snake of fire

Check this out
The square is full of riders
How do you know
Now the time is up

You can count
The losers or the winners
No space to be a joker

To be a champion
To be a champion
Bang bang, to the beat
To be a champion
Bang bang, to the beat

When I got my school
I wanna jump around you
Never never stop the music
Cause it's my generation
My generation is on fire

I'm going to driving my car
Because it's time to get up
Don't you worry baby, I'm faster
And now it's allright
Are  your ready to fly?
Hurry up, baby come on

To be a champion
I wanna be the champion of the night
I want to run this race, and make a change
Now I'm the king of the light
To be a champion
I wanna be the champion of the night
I can, to win the game and ride the lane
And take the best of the life

Now I'm rocking with you
My engine is like a warrior
Ever ever take my power
Cause it's my celebration
And don't you stop my desire

And a beautiful day starts with you
Where the love is my only direction
I don't wanna complain but I miss you
We can't stay far away, my honey

Free all desire, it's a suggestion
Nothing can compare to you
Keep it alive
Got to find my world, so true

Mayday to the sky
Baby, please don't waste the time
Furious and faster, give me the answer
Come on, let me know
Mayday to the sky
I just feel your help tonight
More than affection, my pure intention
Gonna ask your love, mayday

If I hear that you say please don't go
I will walk in a deeper emotion
Lighting up on my stage and kissing you
You are the girl I want, my honey

Nobody
Take me so fast
Only you

Stage divin'
Ride in the light
Come to you

Space lover you can't steal my heart everyday

When the music surrounds all the things
I'm ready (to) back in town
Please don't turn off the moon
And come on rock my way

It's time of fighters
With your night desire
Go to disco
Where the lifre is burning
And my feeling is true

It's time of fighters
Go to kiss the power
Jump to disco
Where nights are waiting for you

Racing for love
Or racing for myself
Destiny please don't choose for me
I don't need breaks
I don't need luck to get number one in this crazy race

Demon of the attack
I can feel the accelleration
Banging the bass
Turn up the treble
I'm gonna win this game of life
It's my...

Turbo disco, turbo explosion in my car
Turbo disco, charging power in my heart
Turbo disco, turbo fighter hard and strong
Turbo disco, rocket rolling all night long

Now you can't see
But now you can feel me
I'm gonna win, you can retreat 
I got no fear
I like to dare I'm moving so fast reaching out the sky

Spending the night with my laptop
Trying to stay away from the bad stuff
Waiting the new destination
Made in my imagination

Another way to understand reality
Another blaze to get back my hope alive
Only the brave strive to change their destiny
You give me thrill because love is being together

Something beautiful happens into me
Something beautiful that I never seen
In the peak of the night you are farway
Like a spicy delight, I wanna taste you again

Something beautiful happens into me
Something beautiful that I never seen
It's a very long time, I'm wanting you
As a look of desire, a something beautiful

Writing a post on your website
Wondering if I get to the next stop
A lucky day to remember
Come to my lunar station

Lovin' you

Forever young
Livin' together as one

The reflection of your eyes
Keep on turning around my body
For your pasion for your smile
For the beauty of that night an

It's incredible
And invisible
All the feelings we've got inside
It's a miracle
Gonna take your love
All around my body
Dancing with the nation

Halleluya Tokyo
Time has come to make a party
Halleluya Tokyo
I can feel inside your fire
Halleluya Tokyo
Time has come to make a party

Tonight will be the magic moment to ride
The fear I've deep inside is growing

They're catchin' me but I’m not ready to fly away

Gotta move on
The time's goin' on
Help me baby it’s the black U.F.O

And crash away the little green men tonight
They're catchin' you but you don't wanna fly away
This place's yours oh my lord

Walking away's the only thing that
You'll understand on your own

Even if you cry it doesn't
Change my point of view
You know it's up to me to face it
But I have nothing to lose

Living inside a dream
Has been my right of way, run away
Dreaming of you has been my strength
To wipe those tears and hideaway

Don't be afraid, it's been the fate
You got my body, my love and hate
Stopping the tears, please do not cry
You know the time is passing by

If tomorrow I came back to you
And in a moment I think it's ok today
You leave, so baby love me once more

Baby please don't tell me
All the sadness of the crew
Honey you know I'm going to leave you
Love is just for the weak

Want to be my lover

I have news today I got to say
I've found a little treasure
I did not expect to find my way to happiness

Listen to my calling
Listen to the things I say
Let the message take off
Let me say it clear

"Baby be happy because I love you"
Nobody else as much as I do
I realized it after a sleepless night
Come on! Come on!
"Baby be happy because I love you"
Nobody knows it as well as I do
And it's today that I decide
To let you know
You know? I love you!

It's the best surprise of my whole life
A present in the morning
I look at myself the mirror plays the biggest smile

Realizing over the motion
Give me back all the time
Think of you on my line

Don't use the key on my desire
To remain in my life
Don't you open the door

I'll never leave you
Recall satisfaction
That only you can give
Turn on the radio
The music is higher
And set your body free

Wake up and start to dance
'N' give up from your trance
Treat me like a woman, don't lose control
Wake up and start to dance
Tonight, give up your chains
Lucky, I feel so lucky, my dancer

Uoh-oh, my dancer
Uoh-oh, you'll be my dancer
Uoh-oh, my dancer
Uoh-oh, you'll be my dancer

In the daylight
In a whisper
Say your words of love

In the moonlight
Like a shadow
Walking down alone

You and me can be the fever in my soul
And all the world
Can be happy when the boys and girls fly up

U never say goodbye
Because I love you
In the night I always feel so blue
U never say goodbye
Touch and hold me
Baby, I wanna be your only truth

What a reason
It's my freedom
Writing on the walls

Won't you know me
Really know me
In a night, so long

I love to like a girl on love
My guy I need you tonight... begin...
You told me "Baby, now don't cry"
And I felt you leaving my heart, so hard

Acting like a Casanova
My king of love, you take it easy
But you're gonna feel so low
I wait for you, remember
My bed is empty without you, baby
I miss you tonight

I wanna feel your joy and sorrow
What kind of love with you?
You never tell me truth
I wanna feel your joy and sorrow
You can believe me forever
Babe, remain in my head

Can't get enough
Dreaming of this dream I do
Of me and you - together
Can't get enough
Thinking all the things you do
Of what you do - forever

Stronger than the pain - play this game
Because my loneliness kills me more
Love you all the way - 'till the end of days
'Cause I've been waiting for you too long

I know, you know it's
Dan - dan- dangerous
To play with my heart tonight - tease me, you can't do it
Dan - dan - dangerous
And nothing that you can say - stop me if you can
Dan - dan - dangerous
To play with my heart tonight - chase me, you can't do it
Dan - dan - dangerous
And no place for you to hide - stop me if you can

Can't get enough
Longing for it for so long
Of what we do - together
Can't get enough
Wanting all the things I want
From you for me - forever

Look in my eyes tell me the truth
There's a girl between me and you-u
Don't tell me lies gimme the proof
That your love is real and good

Just with you a special feeling
Fills the air around me
I can't think 'bout my life without you
Here by my side

Don't let me down
You got to stay with me
'Cause nobody ever loved me baby
Love me like you'd own my destiny
Uo-uo-uo

Don't let me down

Please hold me tight
Gimme your heat
Make me feel your lovely heart-beat
Don't say good-bye
Don't leave me here
You're the one that took off my fear

Remember us only in the sunny days
Remember
Because the rain now is falling in our life
Is falling in my life

Do you think your smile will take away my sorrow
Do you think that we ca stay like friends as you are saying today

Don't take advantage of my heart just because I love you
Just because I live for you
Don't take advantage of my feeling now that you are leaving
Now that you say goodbye

Don't take advantage of my heart just because I love you
Just because I die for you
Don't take advantage of this woman 'cause is only human
Now that she's saying goodbye to her man

Remember me only for the love we made
Remember
Because my heart now is like a desert dry
And lonely in the night

Through the rain I'm driving my car
Many buildings many corners
And my mind is going so far
To the place where we were lovers

In those crowded roads I can feel
Just your presence and no one other
Faces after faces I see
I'm happy just there out on the street

I found my love in New York City
New York City
Big town that never sleeps
We'll stay alive until tomorrow
till tomorrow
In this jungle of streets

I found my love in New York City
New York City
Shining big city lights
Forget your pain and all your sorrows
all your sorrows
Get just this magic night

Through the tears I'm driving my car
Many buildings many corners
I will keep you deep in my heart
It's the place where we were lovers

You used to keep me beside
There's nothing now you can hide
I changed the way I was feeling inside
'Cos now I see your disguise
I'm done with those empty lies
Pretending now that you're only surprised

Expectation
On our dreams together
Adoration
Of your body
Revelation
So when the morning comes
I'll say good bye

I won't be a prisoner of love and rage
I don't think I'm strong enough now
Prisoner of love in cage
Runaway love
I won't be a prisoner of love and rage
No more living in the shadow
Prisoner of love in cage
Fly away dove

And there is nothing you can say
To change my mind right now

You're always keeping me down
I'm tired to wear a frown
You should have known that I would soon be gone
I'm ready to live my life
And baby don't be surprised

Too mouch hate in this world

Looking inside deep in my mind
I'm trying to find a reason
We live in this way
So distant we stay
Our lives are becomes a prison.

Baby whenever we are together
I feel like I'd breath
For the very first time
Together forever
Don't leave me
Cause I never need you so much
In my life.

And now I'm missing you
Like no one else can do
I wanna spend all my days and my nights with you
And now I'm missing you
I wanna see you through
I wanna know if your love is for me and true.

We walk by the way
So close everyday
But there is no love in our days
Now I wanna change
And you want the same
I don't wanna live between lies

I don't feel attraction
I was killed in action
Working all the day I'm not satisfied
Just need emotion
Give all my devotion
Loving all the night and don't feel me tired

I just need special feeling for live
And a boyfriend too
I've got all my desire to give
Don't be alone anymore anymore

Another day another lover
Another dream of broken hearts
Another life I will discover
I'm gonna fly ten miles apart

Another game another river
Another dream that makes me start
Another way I will discover
To fly away and don't come back, Don't come back

Looking for some action
Need no more distraction
Close my eyes and try to drive in the show
I will be a new emotion
Star in a new faction
Never sadness never more wear frown

We got to live this moment
We got to take this chance now
You look at me in silent
You shy boy let me show how

This connection make out mind go far away
Far away in the wind
Communication break down when your body is next to me

You a mystery to love
A mystery in the night
Can you feel me heart goes boom
Boom boom baby
You a mystery to love
A mystery so bright
Baby let my heart goes boom
Boom boom baby

I see you coming closer
I see you take my hand now
Take me in a bed of roses
Come baby I will show how

Each time I see you so nice at my eyes
I feel like burning deeply bright
If you are smiling at me by my side
I feel the happiest girl in life

So please don't leave me alone stop crying this night
And take my heart on your own you should be right
I hope you'll love me again just now but
Never let me sad inside

Sunny love, you and me forever never leave me
Sunny love, you and me together such a feeling
Sunny love we stand together crazy town
Sunny love, you'll be my lover
When you are deep inside my mind

As you appear at my light everytime
I am so moved and deep in to my mind
When you're coming with me for a while
You'll ever shine a star in the sky

Jump in the middle ah moving car
I just can't get on over the night, god help me
Got to pick up my arms and legs together, now or never
Falling in love with my best friend
Nothing can take me away from my best friend
Flying above like an angel
Nothing, nothing nothing at all

Tell me you'll hate me tonight
Tell me you like me just right
Tell me you want me today and everynight

Tell me you'll hate me tonight
Tell me you like me don't fight
Tell me you want me forever you're my light

Running fast and I'm cruzing hard
Ah wham bam feeling playing around oh baby
Stuck in the middle it's getting late so crazy, don't look hazey

Tonight you called me on the phone
And all I'm livin' for was gone
And the story goes...
On and on and on.

And I don't care who's right or wrong
I can forget and carry on
If I can't have your love
Runaway, runaway.

TONIGHT
Tonight
I wanna live my life
Forgettin' all the tears I cryed
I'm leaving you forever.

TONIGHT
tonight
It's gonna be alright
I know that I can find my baby
(Who'll) love me
Kiss me
Drive me crazy.

I'd rather be with someone else
To be with you don't make no sense
And I'm all alone
On and on and on.

If you feel like you need somebody too
Why don't we dream together
If your spirit is running out of energy
I can fill it with passion

Precious love is no flame that burns out
Never traps in a heart beat whisper
You're the one I could hold forever
Ready for your love like the night needing daytime

You're my destiny
You're the reason that I live for
Everybody else is awaiting
'Cuz I believe in you
Share the moment of devotion
Ever wishing on your love, babe

Everytime I've been looking for your smile
One in a million, baby
Always searching for all we have this time, you see
One way ticket to heaven

Every night I sing a song
Full of love for you
Little pretty song
Sweet melody

I will take my lovely star
I will put my dreams apart
I will touch the moon
Love me soon
Take my melody

Dancing to the moon
And take your time
Singing in my room
Your love is right
Love is like a magic rainbow
Love is on the air

Dancing to the moon
And take your time
Waiting in my room
Another night
Love is crazy love is passion
Right direction for ecstasy

Please don't stop this harmony
I will sing for you
Take my fantasy
Please look at me

"Always we'll be together" You said that anywhere

It's too late, Can we go back to the place we used to be?
It's my fate, How hard and cruel to me!

Don't go baby! I want you back, boy
No no no no darling
You are the top

Don't go baby! I want you back, boy
No no no no darling You are the one

Don't go baby! I want you back, boy

Now I pray that you're thinking of me

Sing song, I've got what you want
I want to play my song
To win your love my babe, oh yeah
Sing song, no matter how long
It takes to turn you on
Why don't you come on

Face to face
Make room for my love in your heart

You need a story to believe in
Love has gone
You call me down call me up
Love is slippin away
You better wake up in the sunlight
Once again

It's a blast, when you want to go against the class
And fight to reach a life that you want
They want to forbid you
It's a crime

Day by day, you became a perfect slave to blame
Don't you think you gave your soul to the king?
What kind of man are you now

Lovin' you forever, blowing up my feelings
The light is coming closer
I should be a liar
Breaking all the rules

Fight, don't be afraid to take your freedom
Black power! Black power!

Rain and tears are rolling down on your face
I know it's time to say good-bye

While this rain keeps pouring down
People's so lonely

In the heart of a rebel there's a kind of power ready to explode
In the mid of a battle you can find the most courageous fighter

Wooh, it's the war cry you can hear
Down through the fields over all the mountains
Wooh, it's a shout to know the fears
This is the legend the famous man called

Rebel heart woh ooh
You can lead us to our destiny
And all of us will help you too
In the dark woh ooh
You can show us what is the path to keep
And all of us will help you too

Like a light of a lightning in the night he comes and go on to the ground
He's the best in the fighting he's like one who can kill with no weapons

You are my desire
Burning like a fire
Looking for somebody just like you

Growing desperation
Nights without sensation
Since the day you left I'm not so cool

Shock!! breaking my life in two
Cut my body with a bite
Tear me up with dynamite
Shock!! you told me "baby bye" with a
smile
Such a bang in my mind

Sonic love supersonic love
Thunder in my brain pleasure mixed to
pain
Sonic love supersonic love

Sonic love supersonic love
Fire from a sin deep into my skin
Sonic love supersonic love

much

Looking for my lover
Maybe I discover
Just another woman wonderful

But my desperation
Gives me the sensation
That you where the girl most beautiful

From sky control, to planet earth
Just one thousand miles above the world
The radar shows, intruders storm
Commencing the countdown, engines on

Take advantage on the star dust
Yor spaceships know which way to go
Use the white glow of the sunlight
Get your asses home!

Shellfire, shellfire, too dire
All of us to drop the bombs
Shellfire, shellfire, for players
Tracing bad guys from above

From planet earth, to sky control
The war field is clear now, 'cause we won
No one got lost, no heavy toll
Just call back the kids now, send them home

Hanging out with friends and lovers
Just for something to discover
To make me feel my heart beat
And sweep me of my feet, my baby

Takes some time to find the real thing
One that makes you want it more and more
To feel like never before

Start an emotion
Or make a commotion
Until we lose control
Body and soul, baby
Got to make it work

friend

I tried sometimes to give up the lies
And I was dreaming to fly,
I was just feeling so sorry
Feeling the same, everyday and night
I couldn't stand it alone
I couldn't make it without you

No one betted that you
You'll be my guardian angel
Save me baby, save me now
Don't you see how I care

Will you beg off tonight?

Tell me how many times
You just said to be true
Tell me why, it could be a great tomorrow

Don't tell me now (that) you cannot believe
That you can live by my side
That you can share bad and good times
Feeling the same, everyday and night
I cannot make it alone
I cannot make it without you

With the blue color of the sky
And we can see the side of moonlight
Because I want your love inside

Blue eyes
Across the sky

I'm ready for the event of my life
Can see the color of your eyes
And looking through the light of moonlight
I see you stay inside me

I don't know why our love seems to be overloaded now
I just can't see the reasons
I see you there on the sand throwing bottles against the
wind
We have to talk about it.

It's a sensation that I had one year ago
It's a sorrow

There's no reaction when I look into your eyes
I feel like a

"Renegade", "Renegade"
No more love in you
Masquerade Masquerade as a lover
"Renegade", "Renegade"
After all this time
You don't want to say that you leave me

I lay my hand on your hand but you're talking to other
friends
You're not the same, oh babe!

shower time

For another time to keep you deep inside my heart

Feel the passion like (an) obsession
Got to give a new sensation
Getting stronger now into my body like a flame

It's just the rhythm I want,
Don't you stop the music, 'cause I belong
To something here

Never gonna give you what I can't
Never gonna let you understand

Set me free tonight please let me
Fly into the wild, I'm ready

Feel the rhythm like a fever
(I've) got to dive into this river
Burning hot and growin' stronger
Shining like a blade

Just one night
It's all right
Like a secret destination in my heart
I feel inside
I feel the rhythm of your body like a blade
It's ok
Running back to my sensations all the time
And I feel fine
'Cause I feel the night is coming

And you can
Run and go
Now play the game
Again and again

A secret destination
Give me many emotions
The night is "Love and passion"
Back to my sensations

Just one day
It's ok
Like a star into the sky don't waste your time
No more lies
Feel the passion in my soul and in my heart
It's right now
All the time like an emotion like a flame
And I'm in chain
I feel the rhythm of your body

Take your time
The music comes like a fairy-tale
Get ride on time
To dance the night
(and) to make love

I want to find a reason
Gonna be higher in the middle of the rhythm
Just a beat inside my heart

Change
Tonight I'll try to change
I want to take a chance for me
My heart inside is real

Get for another
Change
Unmistakable change
Tonight I want just to feel
The music takes a chance
Ready for change!

Ride on time
Get up and change!
Feel the power babe
I'm not to blame if I can't stay
What a shame!

I've got to dance above and
Changing the rules, I know the music's starting over
Indestructible (is) my heart

Take me in you're arms,
Keep holding me tight, don't you ever let go
You can make it right,
Keep shining the light, baby please let me know

Someone really needs you baby
I'm the one that wants you now
Come let me feed you baby
Feel you up and love you down

Dance and take all my time baby,
YOU'RE IN MY HEART, can keep me so fine
Dance and move it all right babe
YOU'RE IN MY HEART, come give me your love

I feel fine my love
You never know how, when you next to me
Come inside my heart
I gotta tell you, now I'm lover for you

I was standing in the shadow
Of another broken dream
I was searching for the colours
Showing me the light again

I was so blind
So sad and feeling blue
Till I finally set my eyes on you
The black of lonely nights all turned to gold

You've brought the colours in my heart
There's no more black and white, there's only shades of light You've brought the colours in my heart Just say your love won't fade away You've brought the colours in my heart There's no more black and white, there's only shades of light You've brought the colours in my heart Please don't you let them fade to grey

So when we're close together
I'm just feeling in the pink
All the world is looking brighter
All my days are light bluegreen

It's a rainy day and there's nothing
to do
And there's nowhere to go...
Got to find a way to have fun,
But I guess I have to stay at home...

I called my friends
And I asked them to come over
and play
But they were too busy for that,
And I am so lonely...
This is what I'll do...

TV SHOW! I'll watch the T.V. show!
It's the best thing to do...
Gonna watch the...
TV SHOW! the fun T.V. show!
And just relax, eat some food...

It's the only way
When there's nothing to do
And I'm home all alone...
Every other day I have fun,
But today I have to stay at home...

Tell me a lie I'll tell you one too
Think it out is taht what you want to do
Could be beter if you were more true why
Special things cause so much pain

Maybe I'm just the same fool
Hoping that for once in my life the page will turn
I have waited so couldn't stand
To go back inside of the darkness

Since you came to light my fire
I'll give you all the love I have
Since you came and filled my heart
Of all the loneliness inside

I prayed since you came to light my fire
I'll give you all the love I have
Since you came I've lost the fear
I've always tried to hide inside

Give me your life I'll give you mine too
Stay with me if that's what you want to do
Could be better if you were more true why
Special things cause so much pain

I'm losing my peace of mind
Dreaming of you baby all the time
I'm ready to take my chances tonight

You never lose your self-control
Please let me try to hold you tight and
Feeling so romantic
Touch my body baby
And say that you love me

Be my lover
Say you'll be my love forever babe
Be my lover
Feel your heart so close to mine my babe
Be my lover
Say you'll be my love forever
We were born to be together
I won't forget you made my life
Moments in love

These feelings I cannot hide
Are the same you're keeping down inside
Get ready for some romancing tonight

Baby it's hard to believe
Deep in your heart you're turning to me
I knew you were like a tramp
But now you're shaking my hand
I gave you another reason to live

I wanna love you tonight
Babe I'm not a pretender
Turn off the light
Give you now my surrender

I got to kiss you, don't wanna miss you
Love is all I want to feel oh baby

Stand inside my love
I got to keep you baby in my heart
You turn my life in music in my feelings
Make me feel all right, oh baby

Stand inside my love
I wanna hold you baby in my soul
I got to know that I can't leave you
I wanna live a never ending love

Baby I'm holding the line
Deep in my heart you gave me the light
You know I was like a child
But now we are sharing the life
You gave me a better reason to love

Everyday I want to try to love you
Everyday I want to catch your love
Everyday I want to kiss your lips
Forever ever ever ever

And if you want I will be happy
Baby don't believe in me now
So just baby now
I'm look for ecstasy

Lovely day, my crazy heart is bumping
Lovely day I'm looking for a flash
Running through your eyes my soul is jumping
Wonder fever
Lovely day, my crazy heart is bumping
Lovely day I'm looking for a flash
Waiting for your love, my soul is jumping
Magic lover

Time by time you are coming to my sweet life
Everynight I'm dreaming for your love
Babe please don't make me crazy all days
For passion passion passion...

Got to say what I'm feeling in
Got to stay another moment
Got to say Mr president
Many things that should changed

On and on runs the life
And still I don't like
I things I feel around
And still I don't like Mr president

I got to say what I'm feeling
Mr president
Let's me say, Let's me scream it louder
I got to say for a minute
Let's me stay in your golden office

Got to pray day the lord
Got to pray for all my brothers
In the night, more, to have the chance
Only chance that I got to say

When we met that day I brought you out the dark - out of the dark days
Then you fell in love with me but I was bad - and I made you cry
The beginning for me was just a crazy game of love
I know but, now that I love
I love you so very much
Why you tell me

Forget my heart and everything
Forget my smile and tears
You were too scared to let me in your life
Delete me from your memory
Forget my eyes, my past and then
Forget my future days
Don't call me 'cause now I am not alone and let me live my love

When you cried I use to sit so close to you - close to you all night
For two years your pain was just the pain of mine - but I made you cry
The beginning for me was just a crazy game of love
I know but, now that I love
I love you so very much
Why you tell me

Forget my heart and everything
Forget my smile and tears
You were too scared to let me in your life
Delete me from your memory
Forget my eyes, my past and then
Forget my future days
Don't call me 'cause now I am not alone and let me live my love

Is it too late to begin
A new sweety love affair
Is it to late to come in
A new freaky disco dance

Gotta go there so far away
Gotta go for a life that I
Really don't know
Get me started to walk alone
And get me started to leave behind
My home boy

Good, good, "GOODBYE ROMANCE"
Gotta go
Good, good, goodbye to friends
Bye bye
Good, good, "GOODBYE ROMANCE"

Good, good, goodbye to friends

I'll miss you all for sure

Each and every morning I feel the need
to call him
Maybe he'll come tonight (and) I'll wait
and see
Each and every morning without him
is so boring
Making me want to go somewhere
and scream

When I see him I'll ask him why
I'll ask him why he never called me
When I see him I'm gonna try
To let him explain, I'm going insane

Screaming for some loving boy
'Cause my heart is pumpin' and I need
somethin'
Screaming for some loving
You got my pressure jumpin' I need
your lovin'

Feeling sad and lonely I'm hoping that
he calls me
Maybe he'll call tonight. I'll wait and see
Feeling sad and lonely, it's raining yes
it's pouring
Waiting around just makes me
wanna scream

Thinking about you on a sunny day
Walking down the street I'm feeling O.K.
Wasting all my time watching up and down
Trying to forget you've stolen my heart

Open up your heart all I want is talking
All I need is loving you
Open up your mind you can make me right
Just another night

ABCD Honey won't you look at me
Love is the key baby come to me

Love is you baby set me free

Love is the key baby feel the same
ABCD Honey save it all for me
Love is you baby set me free

Save another dance baby take a chance
Never burned in flame I give you my heart
Living on a stage time will never change
When you play again your love songs to me

Lead by the sound of shotgun
Your boots tread on the dust
You load your gun with bullets
You ride into dusk
You can survive in a land
That is full of broken hearts

You can get no Saturday night
Somebody look for you dead or alive
Desperado nowhere to hide
But death is by your side

Baby, me a reason, tell me why

All I need is to know you love me so
All I want is to watch your true love grow

My nights are empty without your whispers
You'll be forever and ever my love

You want to throw away
All the good things we had lived that very day

How can you forget the vibes we had
How come you don't feel sad
Let me guess you want to tease and nothing else

Day after day I call your number
Minutes by minutes
All my time

Why don't you love me
Don't you need me?
That's my passion day and night

How many times we'll be together, babe

And baby now I'm a fool for you
Hayeya
Damnation want to live in sin
Running hot in a spot of damnation it's what I got

We got the choice and a Harley Davidson
It's like a hurricane
Our lightin's flashin' across the sky
We're rolling thunder and pourin' rain

Rock'n'roll rock'n'roll
It's a rock'n'roll damnation
You shake your stuff
Rock'n'roll rock'n'roll
They say we play too rough too rough
Rock'n'roll rock'n'roll
It's a rock'n'roll temptation
We know it's tough
Rock'n'roll rock'n'roll
I just can't get enough enough

Hell's bell's I'm gonna get to you
Oh Satan rise my temptation
Hayeya
Damnation is a rock'n'roll
Dollars into our eyes damnation up in the sky

Nothing can change my mind
I heard you saying, forever mine
I believe (it), that's what you are

Something to me is true
I'll give you way, I'll take my time
All again to see your eyes

Can't you see, what for
Oh let me say
All I want is just your love again
That's all, I care for you

Only more illusions
To take away tonight
Babe can't you see

Only 'cause I love you
I feel for you and me
it's so easy now

Better you try to find
Another way, for feeling fine
All you dream (of) is just to far

Sometimes you're feeling blue
I tell you why, for feeling all right
All you need is just a smile

Far away I've met a little woman (that)
Was dancing right
In my eyes (she) was looking like a "fairy"
Behind the moonlight

Moving on, moving all your body
Feel the beat and baby
Runaway, run for all your dreams
Don't you cry anymore

Push Push Ballerina
Push push dancing high high high
Push Push Ballerina
Push push jumping up and down

C'mon now! I know you're got the power
To keep on trying
On my way I've never seen an angel
Who's dancing like you

When I look at you, you knock me off my feet
I lose my sanity, oh baby
When I look at you, yeah, I can feel the heat
I want you next to me

Every time you flash me your smile
I just go a little bit crazy
Every time you're flashin' your style
I want to be holdin' you

Can't get enough (my senses are reelin')
Can't get enough (I need your lovin' girl)
I can't get enough (you're makin' me want you more and more)
What have you done to me?
I can't get enough (just can't stop the feelin')
Can't get enough (I need your kisses girl)
I can't get enough (just give me another sweet encore)

Stay with me tonight, and we will burn a hole
Into the galaxy (oh baby)
Stay with me tonight, and we will lose control
And make some history

Can't get enough (my senses are reelin')
Can't get enough (I need your lovin' girl)
I can't get enough (you're makin' me want you more and more)
What have you done to me?

There is no fun that we can get togehter
We shake the body, we're victim of time
It's a fast beat we('re) beating together
Tonight I'm feeling so free and light with you

I need to feel the heat
And I can't stop it, no more
Jumping and screaming high
I need to feel the beat
Together standin' alone
Dancing and dancing on!

Oh oh oh dancing to the rhythm
Never give up
Dancing to the rhythm tonight

My life is just like the winter in Holland
My blood is cold and my skin is so dry
And every night I feel like a bad angel
I hope that someone would take me away

I can feel you movin' to the music
What's your name?
Don't make me guess now
Glidin' to a shadowy dark corner
What's your game?
Come on, confess now

No tales 'bout the land, no tales 'bout the man
I won't be theirs I'll be mine

No more theories of the universe
Eyes on mighty primal fire
No more preachers with the telescope
In the mood to say who I am

Humans were made for affection and emotions
That's what I want to believe
We are all physical spirits on the planet
There's nothing else to reveal

They look for the truth, they look for a proof
It make me lagh, oh my god
And it's not way up, and it's not way down
There's nothing here to be found

Ready now baby go wanna see your show

We dig dig dig dig dig dig dig in our mine the
whole day through
To dig dig dig dig dig dig dig is what we really like to do
It ain't no trick to get rich quick
If you dig dig dig with a shovel or a pick
In a mine! In a mine! In a mine! In a mine!
Where a million diamonds shine!

We dig dig dig dig dig dig dig from early morn till night
We dig dig dig dig dig dig dig up everything in sight
We dig up diamonds by the score
A thousand rubies, sometimes more
But we don't know what we dig 'em for
We dig dig dig a-dig dig

Heigh-ho, Heigh-ho
Heigh-ho, Heigh-ho
Heigh-ho

Heigh-ho, Heigh-ho
It's home from work we go
[Whistle]

I can't believe it!
I've got a nightmare again
Can't remember...
I was a knight and I'd lost
My shining Armour
No direction that I could follow...

Wake up! isn't too bad to get up
Forget about your nightmare
This time you'll like
To get out of hand again

City lover city rider... I wanna go!
Fighting again like a tiger
Down to the town I just wanna freak out
Rocking your body forever
City lover city rider... I wanna go!
I've got a burning desire
Down to the town I just wanna get out
Sticking together & ever

Can't forget it
Dreaming again to be lost
Lost forever
Without my powerful light
I couldn't struggle
Nothing shining around me

Flash in the heat of the night
Stay close to me baby, don't close your eyes
We're in danger and we need to know
If it's real

Come on show me the rest of your score
We can survive in this virtual time
Baby fighting the best way we can
Play the game

Put your finger right into the screen
You can digit the password that we need
Don't forget it and keep in your mind
You don't have another chance!

Baby go! Baby no!
Tell me what you wanna do
In the line of fire
Here we go! Let me know!
Take or leave it, you must go
In the line of fire

Nobody knows that I can
Play all the game right away till the end
In the line of your dangerous love
I can play the game!

Stay
Honey with me
You will be free to tlak about anything
Hey

Your only man forever and ever, babe

With the radio on singing along with a feathery groove

Mickey and Minnie on a moonlit night
Mickey and Minnie on a moonlit night

They head for the fire and dance to the rock'N'roll band
Laughing and dancin' real slow and holdin' hands
Then of to the drive in for a soda and a scream
This is the happy night, this is the special dream

Mickey and Minnie on a moonlit night

Believe me honey
Only you

This night I had a bad dream
I thought that I was losing you
All helpless into space I'm falling
Stealing away my memories

Break down every time I see you
I'm losing my brain
With you it's really amazing
Come darling, back to me, coz I want just you

Magical

Seven days
And I can't find a way
The way you move the way you treat me baby
And my car
Is taking me so far
And keep on trying to forget you baby

Loving you

You've been breaking my heart
Gonna tear us apart
There's no chance I can find a way

Singin' for love, bringin' to you the sound
A world of fire, stars and power
Open your mind and dream forever

To dance another night away
Under the moonlight, I feel like a starfight
A kinda magic and a music highlight
Get you down, feel me now!

Night Flight to Tokyo lights in the videos
Makin' me dancing, I'm livin' free

Open your heart, dance to me all night long
You feel the rhythm ev'rybody
This is the time for me to take you

I gotta get to go faster
I gotta get to be pushing down
You gotta see me now flashing
You gotta turn but I'll just be gone

I got a pressure, I got a fever
I got a shiver inside baby
You bet I'm moving
And do the race for fans
And I'm first again

Overload
It's an energy that can get me go forever
Overload
All under my control
I feel
Overload
It's a magic I can see takin' us to gather
Overload
Clear in the face I feel
Overload

I gotta take you to my race
I gotta feel you just wanna play
You gotta get to see my face
You gotta see me now run away

You will rock my heart
And then be my love
Two stars will be together
You will rock my heart

My heart is beating
And my soul is blinding
I'm crazy for you
And I wanna tell you
Take me so higher
My baby my fire
And say no! You want live me now

And fall into my world
I want you so!
And see how beautiful is love
If we will be together

Rock my heart!
And fly to me baby
You're getting me crazy
Take my love
And then forever be mine
Be the one
Just be the one I need now

My heart is beating
And my soul is blinding
Remember my eyes
From now till forever
Give me your passion
Your love and devotion
Believe me my love is so strong

In the night
While I'm walking into the dark
I'm thinking of you
You're my light
You're the screen the reflexes my heart
There's something with you

Come to me my baby to the world of creation
Take me higher lady if you want my devotion
Show your love to me
Honey can't you see
Take my hands and never let me down now

Pamela ho ho ho
You've like a dream inside my dream
Pamela ho ho ho
Into the sky we share this love together
Pamela ho ho ho
Love is an angel in the dark oh!
Pamela ho ho ho
Don't wanna leave you baby now and never

In the blue
When I think that you will understand
The power of love
And for you
I would do all the things that I can
To get in your soul

Magical!
Oh! it will be so magical! babe
Rhytmical
You'll be the one I need you so lady

Natural wisdom
White here tonight for me and you
Believe in me
Give me a kiss and then hold me tight but
Never say
You're leaving me

Kiss me before midnight!
My love is it now or never
Kiss me before midnight
Forever'll be young together

Wonderful
Oh! it will be so wonderful baby
Clinical
My love for you is clinical! lady

If I had a magic wand
I will take it and use it
To create a special day
And paint my tomorrow

Wonder if I could climb upon a big tree
Who knows if you see me
Wishing that I could fall down right behind you
And fly away together

It's a miracle, it's invisible
That's illogical superfantastico
It's a mircale, so incredible
So electrical, when she looks at me

And I touch the ground, look for me around
Like a fairy tale, I want her any way
It's a mircale, unbelieveable
That's illogical superfantastico

Till today I couldn't do it
But this the past
Now I know there is a place
Where my dream has come true

Sunny days and starry nights
Lazy afternoons
You count the castles in the clouds
And hunt the little toons

But somehow right before your eyes
The sun fades away
Everything is different
And everything has change

If you feel lost and on your own
And far from home
You never alone, you know

Just think of your friends
The ones who care
They all will be waiting there
With love to share
And your heart will lead you home

Funny how a photograph can take you back in time
To places and embraces
That you thought you left behind

They’re trying to remind you
That you’re not the only one
That no one is an island
When all has said and done

There’ll come a day when you’re losing your way
And you won’t know where you belong
They say that home is where your heart is
So follow your heart know that you can’t go wrong

Forever and ever
Is a very long time, Pooh

Forever isn't long at all when I'm with you
I wanna call your name forever
And you will always answer forever
And both of us will be forever, you and me
Forever and ever

I wanna stay like this forever
If only I could promise forever
Then we could just be we
Forever you and me

Forever and ever
Forever and ever
Is a very long time, Pooh

Forever isn't long at all, Christopher
When I'm with you
I wanna be with you forever
I want you right here beside me forever

One thing you should know
No matter where I go
We'll always be together
Forever and ever.

I wanna know it all it's a wonderland
Tonight I'm on the run with you my babe
I'm in love with all I see in big Japan

The city lights
Rolls on the river and I feel alright
Unfinished roads and we're together

Walk in the night
I don't feel emotions
Lost in the dark
For all the rest of my life
I've not doubt, I'm losing your love, baby
I know, will be hard without you

Energy, to fill my body
Fantasy, I need you too much
Come on my love, I'm waiting for you
I won't forget, don't let me down

(I say you) BYE BYE BABY
How many times will pass before we'll meet again
(I say you) BYE BYE BABY
My life is chargin' from now on!

Give all my soul
To someone like you
But nobody else
Will be the one love for me
So I'll spend my time to drive people crazy
Will be harder explain without you

Some kind of feelin' is starting to lift me higher
My heart is missing a beat when someone turn the music on
And now I know
Loosing myself in the rhythm it's my desire, what a fire
And as it comes to my ears I don't wanna let go forever no more

Don't stop your feet on the ground
Just keep on dancin' around
And when the sun it's going down we're going loud

Don't stop the music don't stop
Don't stop the groovin' don't stop
Don't stop the feelin' don't stop
Don't stop the movin' never stop
Don't stop the music don't stop
Don't stop the magic don't stop
Don't stop the rhythm don't stop
The movin' never stop

Where is the way to the place we can live together
Where all the pain could be washed far away by the melody
How can it be?
Music it's callin' the people to make it better
And with the thrill of a brand new song we can sing forever

I felt so worried when I spent all the time
Thinking of the future of us
'Cause I know there's nothing that I 
Really want to know

And then I met you, so I could feel
What you should know, I finally find your love
And now I'm really feeling all right
'Cause the nightmare has gone
This is the way to love you

I want to change the world
Walk again, never miss the way
Don't be afraid, I'm with you
And we can fly away
If you can stay with me forever
Change my mind
Won't get lost if your passion's true
I'm gonna fly with you again
So you can spread your wings
And you will fly with me away
It's wonderland

We gotta swim against the tide and the flow
Till the day when we'll get your goal
You will see that your desire
Will be granted again

This is the feeling you'll understand
The trouble life
It won't be too bad to face
And any problem you will see
Will not be too hard
If we can walk beside you

I want to change the world
Walk again, fight against the wind
Don't be afraid to be true
'Cause now you have to bring 
The power of your smile in your face to
Change the world
Keep on holding on your desire
You will get our shining love
That you can reach alone
If you go on to get your goal
It's wonderland

Thinking of the future of us

Giving me the fear deep inside

Get ready now! A roaring success for me
I really like it!

I have often dreamed
Of a far off place
Where a hero's welcome
Would be waiting for me
Where the crowds will cheer
When they see my face
And a voice keeps saying
This is where I'm meant to be

I'll be there someday
I can go the distance
I will find my way
If I can be strong
I know ev'ry mile
Will be worth my while
When I go the distance
I'll be right where I belong

Down an unknown road
To embrace my fate
Though the road may wander
It will lead me to you
And a thousand years
Would be worth the wait
It may take a lifetime
But somehow I'll see it through

And I won't look back
I can go the distance
And I'll stay on track
No I won't accept defeat
It's an uphill slope
But I won't lose hope
Till I go the distance
And my journey is complete

But to look beyond the glory is the hardest part
For a hero's strength is measured by his heart

Like a shooting star
I can go the distance
I will search the world
I will face its harms
I don't care how far
I can go the distance
TillI find my hero's welcome
Waiting in your arms...

I will search the world
I will face its harms
TillI find my hero's welcome
Waiting in your arms...

Never ever live you on my home

How many times you turn away
When I need to see your eyes
And I wait for nothing
Oh baby you're pretending

Looking ofr something inmy life
I have been missing for a while
Maybe some good feelings
And you just turn your back to me

Whenver we are together
I can only feel the beat
Can only get to the heat that your heart is always spinning all around

In the night, you're the light
You're the one and only woman for me
In the sky of lovers whoo o o
Can you stimulate my senses
In the night, you're the dream
You're the one and only woman for me
With yout magic kisses whoo o o
I'll be burning in desire

Wasting my time in hopeless dreams
I cannot wait 'till morning comes
Here and there illusions
And you're just getting to my brain

Take all my love shake me again
Come and take me with desire
Oh oh oh !!!
(I) want to get you now to touch you
Take me now, relight my fire
Oh oh oh !!!

In the middle of the desert
I can remember
There I was many times without you
To find a way to be alive

Back to Mexico
Back into my world
You make me dance it right away tonite
Bring me to the land
To discover now
What I need to find my way babe

In the sunrise
Dancing with the night light
Give it to me
And dreaming you forever
In the sunrise
Running to the light
Fading into the moonlight... honey

I'll be back into the desert
To find you baby
There I leave all my secrets honey
To wash away my sins of love

See the moon is getting so close
I'm coming back to my rose
And no one keeps me away
To make it right
Can't say you all lovely things
Remember inside more than ever fun
Beside me

And my river is the ocean
Where you just can sailing away
Holding me tight
Run like the wind and go

Into the night
You gotta fight
You gotta stay for your right
To live without wind of change
Into the range
There is the freedom in the air

Into the night
You gotta fight
You gotta stay for your right
To live without wind of change
Into the range
There is the freedom in the air into the night

Groove is always ready to play
And I'm longing today
To reach my feelings right
Where they belong
The snap unsure you will find
Keep moving in out love
A hero comes on your way

Some other folks might be a little bit smarter than I am.
Bigger and stronger too. 
Maybe, but none of them will ever love you the way I do,
It's me and you, boy.

And as the years go by,
Our friendship will never die. 
You gonna see it's our destiny.
You've got a friend in me.

But I wanna stand up just for your love

Maybe your heart is
Infinity infinity

Your love is like a medicine
Baby take off my jeans
I need full over time injection of love
Sick for your love

'Cause the pills I need for living

Your love is like a medicine
Baby take off my jeans
I need full over time injection of love
Sick of your love
Doctor help me get out
Baby give me your pills

All your fences let me in
Your house of graces that's what I want
(I want I want)
No doubt for my feelings this is reality
And I got no show in my soul
You're my babe

I know that I lost you
Even when you stayed beside
Things will turn out right
But you're blinded from the fight
Maybe I found you
But we could not reach the sky
Holding back my tears
When your shadow disappears

Taking me out of self control
There's so much I need to say
To say you're the one in my soul get over me and
Dreaming the world of love

Get me back to 80's
Getting the way of love
Need no other lady
Only I can do
Babe please don't go away
Your smile is back
I need you here to stay
Get me back to 80's
Singing this song for you
I got love forever
Never forget to
Babe hold me back for good
Get back get back
The only way you should
Get me back

This time will be ours
But our lives weren't bed in flowers
Get me out of this
You don't know how I missed
I see your eyes so dark
Getting fire with a spark
Hold me back for love
That's why I've been dreaming of

I was beside you and than just
I was behind you, oh baby
If I could tell you
How many prayers and tears for fear

Now that you're gonna off
Now that you look bowed
I don't care, I don't mind
I feeld good, I feel fine
How should I meet you?
Why should I text you?
I got the news for you

And the winner is me!
As I got back to breathe
I was up to my neck in you
Well, the loser is you
And it's out of the blue
I don't need no more place to hide

And the winner is me!
As I got back to breathe
I was up to my neck in you
Well, the loser is you
And it's out of the blue
I don't need no more place to hide

It was a blind love, oh my god!
It was a mad love, it's crazy
If I could turn back my senses
I would escape it forever

All boys are coming together
All girls are waiting for better
The music program's not the one we like

They hit the lights and people smile
Beat is high, I drink a wine
As the music changes into Euro-beat then I'll be
fine... the count is:

1.2.3.4. for everybody live on the dancefloor
Let's go to the party as the D.J. pumps up the volume
gonna loose control

2 minutes for getting ready
2 minutes then we go crazy
Next music program is the one we like

Come to me into my life, try to see thru my eyes
Stop the time of your sorrow
Don't be the one who goes by, be the one who
Knows why we can't wait for tomorrow

So! Don't ever miss the train!
Get in! Get up! Get in! Get on!
So! Don't sleep on, so! Just be on
I'll be ready for you...

Move on now baby - Don't wait
Look around honey and play
Don't believe in such as easy world

I can show you how
I'll do it for you

Look, I'm the lady for you, and I'm ready for 2
Don't you say that you're not sure
Hey! Or you're in or you're out, say a yes and I'll shout
It's the time for your own more

There's a place baby I know
We can reach holy dark blue sky my love
In the night you will searching no other love hero

And if the music turns out for fantasy
And our hearts will beat one for love

City lights gave me the flash
And you know you are made for loving me
There is no comfort between
The soul and in the real world

I was down in conversation
I heard you were dead
Crying wasn't my reaction
I felt like hand on me

Waiting for the time
When we'll meet again
I believe in you
Don't ever doubt, forever mine.

Just for you I will survive,
Just for you I'll never die.
I'll light one candle showing you how
I'll win this gamble, I won't be bowed.

Just for you I will survive,
Just for you I'll never die.
Wherever you're now this is my call
I'll never give up, I'll breathe your love

People say I will surrender,
I'll wait for some time.
But I miss your kissing tender,
I just can't get another man

No, I just can't believe you
When you say you're mine
I'm not gonna take another lie
You know that it's over
It's time for me to go
So baby don't say you're sorry

Since we've been together
There were just lies and misery and heartache
Nothing last forever
Babe let's face the truth in our hearts

Time to say bye bye
Open your eyes
Why can't you see it's over
Now, we've gone too far
We got to leave and fade away

Yes, I'm going to leave you
Don't wanna be your fool
And now it's too late to make it right
I got to move over
Find somebody new
I'll be alright don't you worry

Get your heart and mind together
One two three - you'll get what you want
You can find your way to heaven
Go we're flying
On top of the world

Oh baby now you stand up in the crowd
And show the world you got the power to love
Now you gotta scream aloud
You're heaven tonight
Baby you can take me to your heart

Go go to heaven
Go go go higher
We're flyin' up in the sky together
Go go to heaven
Go go go higher
Everybody with me

Changin' time and time forever
One two three - just be what you want
Look inside and find your heaven
Go - we're flyin' on top of the world

Sometimes I gotta feel your arms around me
There’s no reason to me
But to get your heart around me
Till the morning

Sun keeps on burning me
It’s like a fire inside
I keep burning though for you
Give me your emotion

In a burning highway
Right in the midnight hour
Are you burning my way?
Flames caress me till the end of time

In my burning highway
Your in the midst of me
Are you burning my way?
Fantasies will take me to the sky

Highlights I see the flashes of my life now
There’s a future to me
Only with your heart around me
Till we see the

Change your time change your time
Gotta keep your love alive

But is only in your mind

Walking in the night

Lies, little lies
Shabby trick to look so wise
One too much to get in my life
But i'm lookin' for the truth

Dare, you to say?
Lovin' me is the only way
Settle me with your flashy words
But it wouldn't be so fine

So tell me why...
You got all my silly passion
And now my heart is dry...
No more lonely night cos' you'll be ridin' high

Could you say we'll lovin' forever?
Just a little word and tonight i'll be ready to go

Open your eyes

No more lonely fears to cry

Day after day
Open up a better way
To give up with your silly game
Now i have the will to rise

Yes I know that I'm missing the line
That I'm living lost into my fantasy
Don't you know that it's not a crime
Let me alone into my secret mystery

I believe in fantasise oh baby
I don't believe in love I'm crazy
Don't wanna make you cry my darling
Leave me in my deep confusion

Fantasy you'll set me free
I'm living in a wild illusion
Melody sings to the beat
I need a romantic freedom

Fantasy across the sea
I'm sailing with no destination
Harmony speed up my heartbeat
Tonight I'll reach my dreamland

No don't cry 'couse I'm running away
I believe in love are words too hard to say
Yes I know you could blame my mind
Let me live my time my heat is beating wild

I'm just a girl, who's feelin' alright
My dancin' shoes never crossin' the line
But now again I will turn back to you
You're my fire

Don't wanna be your prisoner
You turn my heart all around
In this inferno pleasurette
You can take me high

You're my everlasting fire
Torch me come on burn me so deep

A little shake, a little smile
Don't know why I feel fine
And if you come my way
Make me shine every day

City lights
They never looked so bright
Risin' stars into the disco night
It's in my heart, it's in my mind
To the sky wanna fly

And that’s the way I need you more, love
I know I’m incomplete
When you’re not here with me
And that’s the way I want you more, boy

Gimme your touch
Now and forever
We mean so much
Just when we’re alone together

Don’t ever keep me waitin’
Baby, lay your love on me
I’m achin’ bad without you
I’m a prisoner of my desire

Nothing so complicated
Baby, lay your love on me
My wishes all about you
Hangin’ over in a crown of fire

One in a million girls
I need no cars and furs
‘cause all I want is here beside me
When I’m alone at night
My fancy takin’ flight
And you’re the apple of my dreamin’

Now the party's over
It's finished for today
Put aside your tricks and toys now
Everyone's gone away

But tonight the feeling's got
Too strong to understand
All the streets are callin'
I can never stop

Oh baby - Rainin' in my heart
Now it's time to say goodbye
Oh baby - Wash away the sorrow
Till I'm strong again
Oh baby - Rainin' in my heart
I can start a new my life
Rainin' in my heart until
I'm born again

"Wait until tomorrow
It cannot be that bad"
Don't you try to stop me baby
Ever to be so sad

Stop now and watch me baby
You know you drive me crazy
Hey girl, I got the fire in my blood
Hey boy, go take it easy
Look now, you must be dizzy
Tell me, you better shake it up tonight

Baby that's for real
Switch the feeling
Why can't you believe it
Show mw what's your deal
Switch the feeling
You got to be near me

Watch me, you got the rhythm
Baby, I give up freedom
Show me, you got the keys to my desire
No go, no talk of close-up
Baby, until you shape up
Your way, why should I fall into your arms?

My lips are sealed
Can't tell anymore
The way I feel for you
And no one else, what you've done to my mind
Now I wonder why

You take my soul
And I got no control on my desires
I dream of you
My eyes are open wide

I know my wish
Is bein' one with you
And now I miss
The touch you got so fine
I know my wish
Is that you think of me
Every day, every night, tonight

I know my wish
Is feelin' one with you
I want your kiss
You know that I want it now
I know my wish
Is that you think of me
Every beat of your lazy heart

I'm feelin' hot
I'm feelin' cold for you
I'm feelin' black and blue
This is a game that you can't win or lose
May my dream come true

Now
That the walls of my room confine
The feelings that you gimme hot and ocean wild
I feel alone and need you by my side

In the night
I roam thinkin' bout where you are
And then to follow you my mind has gone so far
No way I'm comin' back into my heart

How soon is love for you and I?
I been lying to myself about you
The time is now for me tonight
I'm burning for your lovin' touch now baby

I close my eyes
And see your face
The posion of love inside my soul
And more I want
Your kiss tonight
The posion of love is emotion

I got so many things in my life
That I never could believe your love may come my way
And now I'm flyin' up into the air

In the night
I roam thinkin' bout where you are
And then to follow you my mind has gone so far
No way I'm comin' back into my heart

Intimate moment,
Intimate secret of love
Romantic feeling,
Romantic side of my heart

I realized it' s not real sentimental loving
I don' t deny, to feel alive
When I get closer to you
Yes I......

Dream of an endless love yes I......
Kept it into my heart 'cause I......
Pray for an endless kiss to tell me
I do love you babe I do too

About my dreaming,
About my feeling passion
Across the nation,
Across the street of nowhere

Why don't you take life as it comes
Why don't you grab it when it goes
That's gonna be wasted time what you really waiting for

Every step you could take on this world
Every thing you should make and you don't
Every time there's a chance to go
Every time there's a smile to show
I wonder why you just say no

Why not (to) bark at the moonlight
Without a break into the night
Why not starting a new fight
And with no chances to survive

Why not running a new car
For us impossible to buy
Why not enjoying your own life
I wonder why you say no why

Why not to lay down on the grass
Why not to smoke it for a rest
You're gonna be all alone what you really waiting for

Love is biting me, can you hear tonight
my love
Love is like a whore, gives and takes you
all in a day.
woh-oh.

But I'm fine I remind the things you
made for me
shaking up my mind turning on my life.
In the night is a cry the only thing I do an
illusion to believe...

Gimme just "ONE MORE NIGHT" to feel
again the beat of your burning heart
keeping my hand on yours.
Gimme just "ONE MORE NIGHT" to
breathe again the freshness into
your bed
watching the T.V. SHOW.

Shotgun to the core, 'cause you knew
where love begins
Shotgun to my heart, when you left to
go to your dreams.
woh-oh.

They told me you've believed in the stories over me

And they told me you've reacted like you actually don't mind

Now I wonder how can you trust'em all
As you know me very well

Is love that drags me in the bed

And mine is these tears...

... For you

So baby come on! Smash your doubts! Make'em gone!
Oh baby you're my alibi
Don't you see? It's in facts! It can't be
You really... ...want my sacrifice?

They charget me with a crime because I spoke his name
And you can blame me for the fact that I replied his phone call

From nightfall until the morning sky
Music is never in short supply
Sound asleep during the midday
We'll be dancing all through the soiree

When we're in love, we won't ever sleep
The bass and the drums make our hearts want to leap
Bring up the lights, let the music begin
Feeling the rhythm as the twirl and spin

Let's experience the masquerade
Underneath the moon and the nightshade
There is no need to be afraid
This is how the game is played

We'll become anyone we choose
You and I so easily amuse
Everyone else seems to fade
In the nightshade

Take my hand and lean in close
Feel the room spin, hear the echoes
Dancing close to the balcony
Soft is the breeze from the Corsican sea

Skin is smooth and your breath is warm
But the wind carries in a storm
So we'll run to the underground
To the beat of a different sound

Baby call me now
Don't leave me alone in the dark
Coz baby I'm afraid of losing you
I really mean it

Baby I see it
I'm really missing you
Missing you
So come to me into the light
And forever we'll be together

Listen to me baby, listen to me honey
Give me the night now
Holding me tight ... Yeah!
Listen to me baby, listen to me honey
Flying far away from the world today
Listen to me baby, listen to me honey
Take me away now
Don't be afraid no
Listen to me baby, listen to me honey
Flying far away from the world together

Baby take me now
Don't let me wait for you tonight
Together we can go to paradise
I really feel it

Call me now, there's a massage on line
You gotta know you got my number right
Everybody's just binding my time
All I wanna hear is, do you still want me ?

No hesitation, you know the destination of
My desire, no secret I can hide
You know this deelin'inside, so crazy, and
Tonight
The line is hot with lovin'

Call me, I'm ready for love
I'm superstitious 'bout your lovin' another
Call me, and right from the start
Boy, I took my changes on you
It's now or never

Get down, got to dial tonight
To hear your words, baby, is the kiss of life
Everybody says you'll never mind
All I wanna know is, do you still want me

Stay I want you to stay
At least for today
You know that I'm
Sentimental
Now you listen to me
'Cause I'm gonna be
The one that will
Breaking your heart

I need to be all alone - all alone
I need to walk on my own - on my own
Thank you for all that you've done
I will keep you always in my heart
And my mind

Kiss me good-bye
I don't know - if I wanna make you mine tonight
Don't ask me why
'Cause I know - that you're gonna be all right

Cry now you're gonna cry
And I can't deny
It's hard to say good-bye baby
Hand just give me your hand
You will understand
You couldn't be
My gold angel

Don't stand so so far away, don't stand all alone
Don't look for another way, don't look back come home

Inside your brain and your heart, inside your mind deep in
you will find what you are are looking for
Beside the bed in the night, beside the steps you take
There's an angel
Teaching you to

Fly...above all beating your wings
You've got 'em baby!
Fly...away like rain overseas
Have your take-off right now

Love power against the dark, you power, your soul
Remember that you can fly, remember to fly

Is it the first time in your life
Or is it just another one-night stand?
Do you make a fool of me
Just like you do it to all those other guys?

Now I'm leading your life on my own on these days
And I don't want to mess with no woman
Get me out of your skin
No, that's hard, I can see
But you're back to save your love, but you can't

Give me up, oh, give me up
Oh give me up, oh, give me up
You got this on your mind
I'm telling you again and again

You'd better stop this playing on my mind
Take an intermit stand cause you don't have a clue
Now I'm reading off time before you
Shout it out the roof as you must understand
I got somebody else on my mind

I don't really a nice way to say the things
I wanna say, let stoke the beat 'cos I need your heat
Get your body feelin the heat, what makes me see you
This way baby ain't I good for you? take the time
To know me 'cos I'm losing my face, you're down and out
Just come on over to my place and dance
Let's do the same and generate, get what you need
Let's make the time

Generate, something into me
Generate, do it my 'cos it should be
Generate, some of your heat into me
Generate, we get to make it the real thing
Generate, the movements you make
Generate, just do the way that your mind thinks
Generate, I don't care just do it
Generate, come on and do what you want to me

But now I wanna feel, but now I wanna hear
But now I wanna dance near the tension to the sound I'll go
Let me try to communicate even to disturb the dancers again
When I tried to make it on sunday
"Sister golden hair" surprised
Now I wanna live to the tension, to the place I work
Let me try communicate again
Anywhere I could when you're down and out
Just come on over to the place and dance
Let's do the same as yesterday
Let's make the time
Let's come again

Hey pretty girl what you doin' tonight
Come on and dance come and dance all night long
So tap your feet move along and just listen to me

Christmas has come
And all the lights are shining bright
Mistletoe's hung
And you're he one I want tonight

Lying by the fire
Soft sighs
As we look into each other's eyes
Only desire
To be with you on Christmas

Hark the herald angles may sing
Peace on earth and good will to men
Let the angelic hosts proclaim
I just want to be with you again

Hold me tights this holy night
Let me know our love will not fade away
Hold me tight this holy night
Till we greet the dawn of Christmas day

You are all I want on Christmas Eve
Being with you
Our bodies close together
Thought snow may fall tonight
Everything will be alright
Love that we make
Will keep us warm all winter

My heart is cold but my love burns deep inside
My heart cries out but
there's no blame stepped too fine

As the rain comes down on another grey day
As the cold wind speaks through thr city streets
I think of you and all we said
And I'll make myself forget you

I hear your voice I see you everywhere
I hear your voice but I know that you're not there

So many hand-erased hearts are dark in the rain
No one to turn to, no one who'll understand
And let me think of the lights
Ever will they make me forget you

Dance your love away, dance your love away
Dance your love away, dance your love away
Dance your love, dance your love
Dance your love away

I turn my back on everything I do
I turn my back, I never want to be alone

I miss helps in the time
I miss hopefulness that's a sweet tune
Condemn to idle sorrow
Condemn to me, I face the mirror

So long seeking you say "I'm over you"
but baby you know why
I ain't got to realize
baby you know, 'cause you make me so
you make me so in love with you
so don't let them know
I can let you go
I can't let go tonight

Oh baby why?
why tell me here and tonight?
maybe because your love is not the way I want it now
oh baby baby tell me why
you had to tell me goodbye
so why don't you tell me if one chance is all I've got and cry oh baby baby, tell me why

I can't stop flyin' I'm the best at what you do

I start to climb to make you mine
well baby just one more
one more romance

so now I'm telling you why
got to start you fresh

Oh baby why?

And if you leave me
I can't live, my baby
Without your love, without your soul

I have my limits
You should know me, lady
My mind is out of my control

Into the pub you don't stop
To stir and kid me a long
A long like never seen

Mad about you

Boys & girls are light in the world
Youth in them is prayer, now
Pray to Lord of sending
A big spark to your heart

Touch me more

Under my control
You will shine as a diamond

Let me feel it
Once more, once more together
I'm believing in your words tonight
Day by day my heart is open wide
Let me feel it

Rolling Srones
Filled the magic seventies
With a wonder war
Full of music and crazy emotion

Walk alone
In the night along a bridge
Telling "yes" or "no"
I will back into my world

When you play the saxophone
My burning love increasing into you
Can you feel my ecstasy
Into the night, I bring you all my love

Don't know I understand now
That I can't live without you
For every night you squeeze me
Look me through the night
The light of your eyes

Wanna be your lover
Over and over
My feeling goes up to shock
Wanna be your lover
Over and over
Don't leave me alone tonight
Wanna be your lover
Over and over
My beautiful guy, don't go
Wanna be your lover
Over and over
Take yourself, love me all day, all the nite

When you play the guitar, man
Into the groove my mind can fly away
On my side can feel the day
And you discover, yes, my reality

When the rain's falling down on me
(I) need an angel inside my heart
Taking care of me
Taking care of my desire
Then set me free

I wanna catch you now
This is a neverending night
Give me the sun
(I'll) give you my love
Come into my life

Tell me why now the moon is crying
So tell me why
And you'll be mine
Forever you, please don't say goodbye
I feel alive
With you everyday

When the music is part of me
You can see the light in my eyes
Like a shining star
Fly with your imagination
Into my sky

In the middle of the ight
You can't sleep 'cause of your mind
So you think how it could be
If you met just who you need

When the night is falling down
You can start to hear the sound
Of your heartbeat, of your tears
When the emotions fly...

Take a look in your heart and believe in your days, oh baby

Every day, every night you are in love with him
Every morning you try to keep him in your dreams
Every magic delight never will be goodbye
You're gonna live the life with satisfaction

In the middle of your life
You can't stop to love that guy
Think how your future could be
Without who now just you need

If you look him in the eyes
You will see how much love you find
Feel the music in your dreams
'Cause he fills your mind...

Call me now
And I'll wake up
In the middle of my dreams
Take my hand
And I'll follow
Wherever you will take me

I don't need no other place to be
Here I found mine
No more pression will be tearing me

It's not too late, you can carry me away
And everywhere I'll be safe in your embrace, like a child
Don't let me wait
I'm ready for this, ready for this day
I know it's time, we can fly towards the light

Call me now and I'll breka out
From the riddle of my life
Stop the time
And I'll take up
Whatever's there for me

I don't need no other place to be
Here I found mine
No more pression will be tearing me

All I need is a moment
A moment to be with you
And we'll dance in the moonlight
I just wanna lay by you

Until the morning will come
Bringing us happiness
Stay together in love forever
It's a dream & will be real with you

I wanna run to you
We are in love tonight
And everything is gonna happen
'Cause nothing will be the same
We are the stars
(And our light) will shine forever

Hear the sound of these voices
Music is all around
All is waiting for changes
For you and me brand new start

Sometimes I feel
With you
Into my dreams ever
I believe that I will share
The day that I'm living close to you

I guess you'll believe in me
I don't wanna miss you
I don't wanna lose you
Baby never mind if you can feel every night

Never mind never say one day you will be mine
Tell me why do you know me do you want me
It's a love it's so nice I'm gonna love you
Just let me be your fire

Someday I will
Fall in love
With you right now baby
I just wanna keep your hands
'Coz I'm gonna take you far away

I wanna tell you honey
You're my angel in this life and
This time you will see
How deep is my love for you 'cause you

You are the reason
You make me believe
And you make me free
You give me the way to the right direction
So I tell you...

Let the rain
Take away my fear
And let it fall over me
Let the rain
Wash away my fear
And see what it's gonna be

I want to give you baby
All my passion and affection
I need love all the time
I feel your protection deep inside

You're not alone no more babe
You'll never know my silence
I wanna be your angel
Just tonight
We can touch the sky

Now it's the time, tell me why...
I can't believe I'll survive without
You know how much I love you now, baby
Just tell me how do you feel?

Never alone
Tell you what I want to be now...
Your love (and) nothing at all
Never alone
Come baby, no more
Without you this love will make me cry

I'm gonna take you higher
I will be your desire
C'mon I get you started
Just tonight
We can touch the sky

Lay your head
Down to bed
Let your slumber sweep your cares away 
In your dreams
Chase moonbeams
All the way across the Milky Way 

And as you rest
In the nest
That we've made for you
We'll caress
And keep you blessed
Never alone for the whole night through 

Go to sleep
Don't your weep
Tomorrow's gonna be
Tomorrow's gonna be
Tomorrow's gonna be a brand-new day 

And as you rest
In the nest
That we've made for you
We'll caress
And keep you blessed
Never alone for the whole night through 

Go to sleep
Don't you weep
Tomorrow's gonna be
Tomorrow's gonna be
Tomorrow's gonna be a brand-new day

Take my soul
If you leave me I cannot see the light
I will be with you forever

Together... deep inside my heart
I see the light
When I can stay with you and 
Forever we'll be
Close together ever in your heart

From the day we arrive on the planet 
And blinking, step into the sun 
There's more to be seen than can ever be seen 
More to do than can ever be done 

In the circle of life 
It's the wheel of fortune 
It's the leap of faith 
It's the band of hope 
Till we find our place 
On the path unwinding 
In the circle, the circle of life 

There's far too much to take in here 
More to find than can ever be found 
But the sun rolling high through the sapphire sky 
Keeps great and small on the endless round

In my dream
The stars can make you come here
In this town
It's something mysterious
When you're here, there's no more
Complication
In my life, please fly to me

Oh oh oh you're my kind of pleasure
Oh oh oh you're my kind of love
Don't you know you're really my
treasure
Step by step, I'm falling down

Forever
Lost in love
You've got the style, my babe
Lost in love, forever mine
I want you lost in love
Show me your style my babe
Lost in love
Since long long time

I don't know
I dream we'll celebrate each time
We'll meat
My sweetest desire
Call me in time
'Cause I'm afraid you're the only on my
mind
I want you now!!!

In the quiet time of evening
When the stars assume their patterns
And the day has made his journey
To the life we knew
Before the world changed
When not a thing I held was true
But you were kind to me
And you reminded me

You see the patterns in the big sky
Those constellations look like you and I
Just like the patterns in the big sky
We could be lost we could refuse to try
But you made it through
In the dark night
Who would those lucky guys turn out to be?
But that unusual blend
Of my funny friend and me

That the world is not my playground
There are other things that matter
What is simple needs protecting
My illusions all would shatter

You see the patterns in the big sky
Those constellations look like you and I
Just like the patterns in the big sky
We could be lost we could refuse to try

But you stayed in my corner
When the only world I knew was upside down
And now the world and me
Know you carried me

I'm not as clever as I thought I was
I'm not the boy I used to be because
You showed me something different
You showed me something pure
I always seemed so certain
But I was really never sure
But you stayed
And you called my name
When others would have walked out on
A lousy game
And look who made it through
But your funny friend and you

You see the patterns in the big sky
Those constellations look like you and I
That tiny planet and the bigger guy
I don't know wheter I should laugh or cry

Just like the patterns in the big sky
We'll be together 'til the end this time
Don't know the answer or the reason why
We'll stick together 'til the day we die

If I had to do this all a second time
I won't complain or make a fuss
Who would the angels send?
But that unlikely blend
Of those two funny friends
That's us

Bless my soul
Herc was on a roll
Person of the week in ev'ry Greek opinion poll
What a pro
Herc could stop a show
Point him at a monster and you're talkin' S.R.O.
He was a no one
A zero, zero
Now he's a honcho

He's a hero
Here was a kid with his act down pat
From zero to hero - in no time flat
Zero to hero - just like that

Say amen
There he goes again
Sweet and undefeated
And an awesome 10 for 10
Folks lined up
Just to watch him flex
And this perfect package
Packed a pair of pretty pecs

Hercie, he comes
He sees, he conquers
Honey, the crowds were
Going bonkers
He showed the moxie brains, and spunk
From zero to hero - a major hunk
Zero to hero - and who'da thunk

Who put the glad in gladiator?
Hercules!
Whose daring deeds are great the-a-ter?
Hercules!
Is he bold?
No one braver
Is he sweet?
Our fav'rite flavor
Hercules, Hercules...

Bless my soul
Herc was on a roll
Undefeated
Riding high
And the nicest guy
Not conceited

He was a nothin'
A zero, zero
Now he's a honcho
He's a hero
He hit the heights at breakneck speed
From zero to hero - a major hunk
Zero to hero - and who'da thunk

Herc is a hero
Now he's a hero
Yes indeed!

When he smiled
The girls went wild with oohs and aahs
And they slapped his face
On ev'ry vase
(on ev'ry "vahse")

From appereance fees and royalties
Our Herc had cash to burn
Now nouveau riche a'n famous
He could tell you
What's a Grecian urn?

From zero to hero - a major hunk
Zero to hero - and who'da thunk

Herc is a hero
Now he's a hero
Yes indeed!

Waitin' for me you were not so strong
And you just couldn't see there was nothing wrong
You can feel it in your heart it crashes
You've been thinkin' of me
No more cheerless

Has been so many lies ago
When someone made me feel so low
And all my power seem to me to be on the floor, on the floor
I try tot understand this pain
I try to keep it of my brain but now I know there's
One more thing that I have to say

I carry on
'Cause it can't rain forever on my love, I keep on hoping
And so I'll never stop the show, you know I am

Crazy, all my life is so crazy
Don't you live to be lazy
Girl you have to speed up the time and make you happy
Crazy, all my life is so crazy
Not a night to be lazy
I want to feel all the passion that this love can give me

Has been so many lies ago
I've never meant to live alone
For well I know that from now on to you I belong, I belong
I guess I have myself to blame
I'm sure that I won't be the same
'Cause every time I am in trouble I find the way

Here I am baby lost in confusion

From a complicated life

sensation

Tell the world that I'm your only man

All I want is to kiss your lips
All I need is to feel your body
I will keep in my heart forever
'Cause my love - will find the way

Give your soul to me and together we'll be
My love is never-ending, baby
Can't you see there is way to live
When all that I can do is to be without you
Life could be very easy for me
But every night you drive me crazy
I believe that you wanna be free
All that I can see - when I look in your eyes

Never forget to call me
When the nights is dark and you're so lonely

Looking around for sexual illusion
I spend the night in erotic explosion
All right all right
It is my funny side
My action

I'm a devil in love, macho under the skin
Such a sexy star of silver screen
Crazy night gigolo
I'm the king of the lovers
All night lover

I'm a single man, you make me high and crazy
You gotta feel my desire
I'm a single man, and you will be my lady
Only for a night, for a single day-ay-ay-ay

I'm a single man, my baby
Don't stop my love and my fire
I'm a single man, don't spoil my dreams, I'm ready
Ready for your sexy desire-ire-ire-ire

Dark in the night and hearth is so tired
When a man feels like a lonely hearth
I wanna start a new life just tonight
But I need a woman just like you

Darling you are a nightmare in my feelings
Baby you are the madness of days
Everywhere I look around to search you
In my hearth I know only one way

IN MY DREAMS with you only with you
Honey you know I'm mad about you
IN MY DREAMS with you only with you
Honey you know I'll reach out for you

You're in my mind but know I can find
You in every face I'll meet today
I don't wanna stop to keep on to desire
Till I loose my mind and that's what I say

Dawn sets on Monday
The sound of another day at my door
And our hearts lie naked to the core

Can you feel it
Will you always love me heart and soul
When the clouds gather in the sky
And we wake into lonely nights

Out of the blue
You'll wake up in another man's dream
Out of the blue
A dark divide between us
Out of the blue
An empty room where angels are weeping
Under our wings, love dies out of the blue

Hold me to your heart
The day turns into the night as we part
But our love is crying out for time

A new sensational love
And such emotional groove
A new dimension of love to prove
A hero comes from the sky
He makes you scream loud and cry
It's like a thunder of steel at night

It's a bloody combat
It's firing tomcat in your mind (A killing angel)
Listen to the dee-jay
Ready to say hey-hey come on
Beating me

Kami kami kaze for love
We're waiting the sweetest angel of our death
Kami kami kaze for love
We love live in danger baby kami kaze
Kami kami kaze for love
We're waiting the fatal wind that's in your breath
Kami kami kaze for love
We wanna be just your target kamikaze for love

You feel him blow up inside
You know this is the last ride
Tomorrow maybe no pleasure time
So drop your bomb over me
Tonite I wanna be free
I need your love I need indeed

People say this kind of miracle is hard to believe
Baby that's something physical you're doing to me yeah!

Turn around to the sound of my soul, take control
Come feel the ecstasy of alchemy
Bring me up, turn me down, to the skins, underground
This is no time to wonder, feel the power

Miracle
Touch me and I feel supernatural
Baby you're working this miracle
Angel or devil are you - to work this wondrous
Miracle
Never thought I'd feel so incredible
Now I do believe in this miracle
Angel or devil are you - to make all wishes come true

You put a spell, a magical veil on my mind
How can I tell the mystical feeling I find

Don't try to mystify
This is the real life
Something you can't deny
I see the future coming for you

Never give up your secrets
We are starting over we can live forever

I know how to live my life
I wanna feel the sun shine on my face
Reach out for a better time for an open space

You try and you try again
You gotta stop daydreamings all day long
Wake up no you got to choose baby right or wrong
I never let you go

I open up the door
Such a new world for you to see

Let's go to a place you never seen before

What is real tell me now what's going on
What is real good enough to carry on
What is real even try to show me the way
The way to love you

Don't stop baby don't give up
Another day another chance for you
Don't need anybody else you can be yourself
Now there is you and me

Everything's gone away
Remember how you saved your life
You got to be strong today
Whenever you conserve the lies of your own

But the promise you have made me now was gone
(I'm feelin' I lose control)
And the changes you have given to me
I don't wanna give it a lot for free

There's a big hole now in my mind
It's a black hole I'm wasting my time
There's a big hole got to be strong
It's the goal that you need
I don't want to be free

There's a big hole holding me tight
It's a black hole a battle or fight
There's a big hole got to be strong
It's the goal that you need
I don't want to be free
Big hole...

Better watch out today
'Cause everybody take their time
Believe me I'm trying to say
Remember when you'll make me cry, on my own

Up all night sleeping all day
A nightmare baby is running after me
I've to play I've to make my day
I lock my door so no one else can see

I don't cry I don't look back
I don't think about the future so take my chance
I destroy the lovers
A natural desire for me I'm a

Blade runner up all night
Blade runner It's all right
Blade runner looking for trouble today-every day
Blade runner up all night
Blade runner it's all right
Blade runner looking for someone tonite-every night

Up all night sleeping all day
A nightmare baby living in my brain
Blood is food baby I'm not good
With no love my body is in chain

Baby tonight I feel out of control

I want to flash like lightning in the night
Dancing crazy is no crime

Dancing crazy is no crime

Waiting for the sun to shine ain't foolin' me

Everyday while I'm working
Everytime, girl thinking about you
I'm ok but I'm sure
It's not the same for you

Late at night and the moon is low
Candle light what a magic show
Baby, I don't know why
There must be always something wrong

You say "call me, love me"
That's all what I need
So I don't know
Whether to cry to die
Or I'm dreaming
What we'll do together

Stop me, baby
Stop me when I say that

Get off of my way
I'm the Tokyo's killer

I ride my bicycle, someone's hitting behind
I fall onto the ground
Kiss my boo boo
I got my brand new ball, I slammed it into the wall
It bounced back and ouch!
Kiss my boo boo

Everyday and everytime I go out
There is something that goes wrong
And also
Every night I dream about a day when I'll be fine and safe

Mom and dad I need help
I'll be better
Kiss my boo boo
I feel better when you kiss it
I get up I won't stop
Other fellas are waiting for me
Don't say nothing
Kiss my boo boo

The race has just begun I run faster than him
I trip up in my dog
Kiss my boo boo
I'm playing hide and seek, I'm up on top of a tree
I'm getting down too fast
Kiss my boo boo

Lay back baby, tell me honey
Why are you feelin' blue?
Empty hands and lonely heart
I know what is over you

Out the world!
Not gonna come down
We're gonna leave ground
Jump and climb
We need all our dreams tonight

We're flesh and love forever
Let it fly to the never-never
Play with me, two clouds up in the air baby
We're flesh and love forever
I can make you feel right oh better
Heavenly, two stars up in the sky, baby

Please don't talk and say my dream
Is now but a fantasy
Take this longing now don't lose it
Magic for you and me

"We" comes down to just you & I
It's no regret, it's not a surprise
With all the ups and downs you put me thru

Well I forget it all with your smile
Emotions say with you I'm alive
I feel I've no control, I'm so confused

If I could I wouldn't change the world with you

From heartache to heaven
My love is a flight inside the night
I'm feelin' so low then high and
Never come down
It's you
From heartache to heaven
I dive in the wave of your desire
It's turnin' me round and round and
Only for you
For you
From heartache to heaven

Now I wish I'd freeze all my life
Then everything I do would be fine
I'd walk about my feet back on the ground

No freaky laughters runnin' so wild
No colours in my landscape so bright
I found my days so boring and so blue

We may forget, we maybe let
The world now come between us baby
And for a while sometimes we find
Another mind another body

Let the music play
Emotions will drive us all away now
All the tears we cried
Will make us feel strong into the night

One heart, one soul
Back together beating for more
One heart, one soul
Baby now don't you keep me waiting'

One heart, one soul
Open up and let in my love
One heart, one soul
No-one can stop this feeling

Live in a blur when you're not there
Baby I know your hands can heal me
I wanna jump up in the air
And once again feel free and easy

In the night you caught me
With your magic spell
Haunting voices in the air
Beware!

Touching soft my hand
Glowing of your eye
How can I just understand
You'll make me live or die?

Send me an angel!
To lead me through the night
Send me an angel!
To take me flyin' off the ground
Send me an angel!
To guide me to the light
Send me an angel!
And I feel love is all around

Your devourin' fire
And you look so cold
Is it my illusion or a strange
Revenge!

A long time ago I didn't believe you
When you said "Let's spend together one life"
But now nothing's going to change my direction
Cause I love ya, man like never before

My awakening is magic
Everytime you sleep on me
Just one moment formulizing
I never stop appluading you

I wanna give you boom boom devotion
I need your loving to feel
Until the morning lights
I wanna give you boom boom devotion
I need your loving to feel
Until the morning lights
I wanna give you boom boom devotion
I need your loving to feel
Until the morning lights
I wanna give you boom boom devotion
Don't give up, take big chance
Tonight is over, but I need you again

Wanna know where the sun goes down
At the end of a day where you need my lovin'
Tell me now as I turn around
That's the way you want my love

Tonight I'm waitin' for the morning
To start a day in the sun
Tonight I can look for abother day
Shining forever

Another day with you in paradise
Just me and you again
Another night when I can see your eyes
To start a new way
Another day with you in paradise
To give your love away
A better life and we'll be here to fly
To start a new day

Gotta see where the road is going
To the end of a world where I need your lovin'
Show me how to believe in you
Give me heart a chance to live tonight

On pense que l'amour
Ne soit plus dans notre coeur
C'est vrai, oui, c'est vrai

Mais j'ouvre ma porte
Et je vois ma chatte qui sort

Rappelle par l'amour
Elle s'en va se dandiant
Vers le monde sauvage et libre
Elle s'en va le printemps

C'est cupidon le roi assolu de l'amour
C'est cupidon qu'envol ses fleches tous les jours
C'est cupidon qui frappe les bons, les mauvais
C'est pas possible que l'on puisse se sauver
Je l'attends pour vivre mes reves, mes desirs, l'amour

Et comme une enfant
Aux histories je auis croyate
C'est vrai, oui, c'est vrai

Un jour qu'il pleuvait
U am j'ai recontre

La main dans la main
Nous allions nous dandiant
Vers le monde sauvage et libre
Nous allions vers le printemps

Eh dis danc, c'est toi que veux
Eh dis danc, c'est toi que veux
Eh dis danc, c'est toi que veux aimer

Generate adrenaline
Estimate ability
To run after you
Be tainted by you
And throw myself away

'Cause I'm feeling that passion everyday
'cause my memory runs at yesterday
And now's the time
To make you mine again
You'll play a dangerous game

Because I'm bad tonight
You riding on my rockey
I feel O.K.
No matter what you say
Because I'm bad tonight
I'll push you through the limits
I don't wanna know if it's wrong or it's right

Overcome the handicap
Hanging from your fingertips
I know what it takes
Being caught in your wake
That blows myself away

I see temptation everywhere
The situation is unfair cause every man
Is looking sex more and more I dance my way

I know I can loose my self control
So give me your body mine and soul
Stay here by my side I need protection I'm alone

I'm ready for love
Don't leave me standing in the pouring rain
Ready for love I open up my heart to you again
Ready for love you know that sometimes
Pleasure turns to pain
Ready for love but I don't forget the sunshine after rain
Ready for love

It's not the parfume that you where
It's not the hobbies that we share
But simply the way you love me
Tells me that my life will go your way

Love is a feeling love is wanting love
Is a destiny
Love is living love is needing
Love real for you and me babe

Take away your bad feelings
And don't even think I'll let you free
Close your eyes and trust me darling
Love is just the answer for me

Crazy for your love crazy yeah oh baby
Crazy for your love every little kiss you give me
Crazy crazy for what you mean
Don't give up never stop
Giving your love to me

Love is reaching love is asking love
Is a way to be
Love is touch and love is only
Love that we can make together

Everybody want to be a star and very soon baby
Everybody gotta have the look of Richard Gere maybe

And the divas there to feed us
Coz' we're so hungry
And the boys bands setting fake trends
Make girl a fool

It's a final destination
And we don't know where we're going
It's a shining reputation
What we're really looking for
Ending on, all abroad, leave for...
Destination unknown

Everything we daily do looks like a TV show
Oh yeah!
Every move we make it's like we were on camera
Oh man!

I got hypnotized
The day I saw you there
The way you smiled
Just made me wanna dare
As the music started I wanted to be
The one dancing every night on the beat
Es gitano Poquito italiano este mi amor para ti

You're my heart you're my soul
Este mi tango, mi amor
You're my heart, you're my soul
Baila por siempre, mi amor

When love is right, you feel like superman
The world can fall
And you'll be standing there
When it's blowing in your heart let it be
If you fight it you'll end up on your knees
Es gitano, poquito italiano este mi amor para ti

You're my heart, you're my soul
Este mi tango, mi amor
You're my heart, you're my soul
Baila por siempre mi amor

Spending all and making a wish come true

I can't fight this feeling
This bed's too big without you can you see
And I like crying

Days are getting too short

May be it's the time to let me go
I think too much what you sad
That our love will never die

Go away
And don't forget all dreams that we had
But someday you will come and turning back
My heart will break just for one reason now
If you gonna tell me it's over for me

Night & day I feel empty and lonely
You get me out of this
Give me one kiss
Night & day I am living so sadly
I stand on my kisses
Give me one please

You had so many reasons
To go way you couldn't do
I will always forgive you
The step you did but it's o.k.

Look at you now... you look sad, you should
be happy
Wondering how... you feel bad, are you
mad at me

This is the time you should near to love
You really should, but you don't, baby
Maybe you blame everybody else...
Just take a look at yourself

Over & over just, pointing your fingers
Looking for someone to blame
Over & over you, pointing your fingers
This is a terrible shame

Look at you now... runnin' round just
like a baby
Take off that frown, I'm afraid you're
going crazy...

Don't know where I'm going
Tonight with all my feeling
But I wanna get in touch with you
Standing lonely out in the night
Now in the city
Break down on my knees and cry inside

Can't you hear I'm calling
My heart is now so lonely
Take off all your clothes
And then be just my only
Send all my message
But I can't get you now
Lost my head out somewhere for you

Love in Chinatown
Let it happen
Turn me on and we break out
Love in Chinatown
This is now
A new emotion come
Love is your need now

Maybe I was treating you bad
Yes, oh my darling
And everything was wrong
I can get enough to you
If I know that you want me
I will try so long tonight

See the moon up in the sky
When is lightning up this beauty summer night
And the stars are staring to us again
I remember when we used to be just friends

What a dream, what a joy
Walkin' not alone in the rain
Every step and every move is really
Taking my heart to the heat
When you tell me

Ready to play but not with your heart
I really won't to be mean, can you feel it?
Ready to play, I'm ready to start
Maybe we tried just too hard, believe me

On my own I try to be
And I wonder if you really understand
Now I'm here sitting alone tonight
But without your love there is no other game

Get the money having the bucks from you now
I realize all my hopes
Money money talkin about the colour
I'm victim of your money

Come on come on
I need so many dollars
Come on come on
In my pocket from you
Stay here tonite I want from you a million
Dollars right away

RED MONEY
Wanna take your money
'Cause I cannot without
The reason is real

Lot of money what kind of life you like now
I don't believe it's crazy

Give it to me, come give it to me!
Let me inside, I will set you
Free!!!
You must stop, fooling around
Come on baby let's get down

Baby don't you know you're my fire
I can feel in my heart and my soul tonight
Shake my with your hands with desire
For my life and my time we just can't go back.

Everytime I see you, can't lose my way
Don't you know it's my life
Don't go away tonight
Sweet heart, baby, don't you know it's my time
It's easy way for me
And we can try tonight.

TAKE MY HEART, TAKE MY HEART
Take it easy for my life
Take my love, take my love
With me tonight, so long.

TAKE MY HEART, TAKE MY HEART
Take it easy for my time
With your love, with my love
And we can fly away tonight.

Honey can you feel my desire
Don't you see in my face, in my eyes your light
Trust me 'cause I follow the wire
See the way, know the place, we cannot get lost.

Ten-Nine - Like a countdown babe
Eight - Bars, please don't keep me waitin'
Six-Five - You can take my hand now
Seven Times you called me "Angel"

I've got the key inside my pocket
Your love to me is like a rocket
Don't look at me, I'm not a joker
But I can count for you, my lover

STRANGER THAN LOVE
You've got me going crazy, that's my desire

Imagine a banana go on and eat it...
Just don't bite on it, not too hard no
'Cause baby that will hurt really hurt me oh so...

Flash and fight, love desire
Feel alright, into the fire
Lost in time, lover's warriors
People of the night

Superstition, heavy fiction
Earthquake on the mind
See this action any reaction
You... can... try the emotion

Big in Japan big in Japan
The fire
Breaking your heart, a love desire
Big in Japan big in Japan
Obsession
We feel the power, ready for the action

Big in Japan big in Japan
A thunder
Over the night a trembling hearth
Big in Japan big in Japan
Big wonder
We feel the power, moving 4 a passion

Break the night, crazy music
Till the light we move to play it
Side by side a satisfaction
We can start so high

Think about my life
When I was younger I was dancing in the clubs
YE-HE OH-OH
Thinkin' about...

Promises and dreams
Dreams of a bad boy wanted live to find the way
YE-HE OH-OH
People don't know!

Face to face with the devil in race all the time
Please let me play my music!!
Now by now they can see I was right and I fly... high...

THIS HOUSE IS ON FIRE is burning in me
It's like a final match ball
THIS HOUSE IS ON FIRE I'm happy to be
To be that dirty bad boy...

Voices in my heart
Keeping on calling me to let me get this way
YE-HE OH-OH
Voices in me...

What the people say
I didn't let the people tell me what to do
YE-HE OH-OH
People don't know!

Round and round it goes
And another common day is passing
Thru the morning falls
Into the night and nothing changes

The revolution is up to you
Get down to live another life
The hidden force that gets you thru
The dark until you find it

White light all around
I know you see the white light
Sun shine deep insi-ide
And ev'rybody's gonna see you're right
There is a white light all around
I know you see the white lighte
Sun shine deep insi-ide
And ev'rybody's see you're all right

So you can be free
If you find a way to reach your heaven
Where the light will be
Over again so you can go now

Get away tonight
Getting out of sight my baby
Gonna take you to the place of love

Dancing in the sky without control
Only for passion in my soul

Like a monkey in the jungle
Waiting for my wildest start

Speed of the light I want to feel it now, scream so loud!

Looking back
You can remember how the time is gone
The empty mirror when you are left alone
The night is gonna be keeping
Something in your mind.

Looking up
The sky is gonna be so dark tonight
The wind is blowing right into your eyes
Until you see tomorrow
Live just for a night.

Little Russian
You're looking for love tonight

And now there's music coming through the night
Until you see tomorrow
Play just for tonight.

Looking back
Remember you worried only one
But now you can see the lonely days are gone
And you can see tomorrow
Living for tonight.

Kiss me, I give you
My love, I need you
Too much, I feel you
Way too distant
Tell me, your secret
It's mine, the regret
To pretend I'm the only one

Close to you, like I do
And claim possession of your body
I am fine, but I can lose control
Over my reaction

Don't tell me stories
I understand what's going on in your mind
Everytime you and her look into each other eyes
You belong to me

Be mine, I pray you
Forget , as I do
Too much, I love you
Way too much now
Hold in, your secret
It's mine, the regret
To pretend that I'll be just

If you think that are shy
Just to say you love me
Or if you think that we could be
Just good friends is hard

No more distance between us
We can stay together
You can find an easy way
If you are with us

We could meet at any time
It's enough you call me
But if you won't spend more time
Give me just a ring

Romeo and Juliet
But you know the end
If they could communicate
Maybe it could change

S.M.S
Tell me what you wanna say
S.M.S
Tell me what you wanna do
S.M.S
Just to say I like you
S.M.S
Just to say I love you

Someone could says definately romance is dead
But we could have so another change
No more distance, it's only a bad memory
We'll stay together for the eternity

Through the window a red sun's coming in

Your mind is so confused

Take me with your soul of fire noew

It's waiting for you

I want your love
Come on and shake me upside down
I wanna feel it
Take me with your soul of fire now

Do you wanna feel
All my passion, honey it is real

All your lovin' that I wanna know uh uh!

Darling you're my life

Beating of my heart, there is no fear!
Happy like a clown
Feeling like a yo-yo up and down

Here I am, look at me (a) little changed, but it's me
Back again, that's for real, hungry for action
Years ago, people know, I've lost my little babe
Suddenly, passed away when I was on tour

Every thing I'll make
I want it dedicated to my darling
Every note I'll play
Will be for my sweet heart
So now I say

People I'm back, people I'm back in black
Ready for all - my big fans
Pass the word on - 'cause I'm on stage again
Always crazy and not too sad

Yes I'm back, back in black. It's for sure (I) got no doubt
No remorse, no repent no time for regrets
Speak my name, I'll be there, count to 3 and I'll go

Here we are, living on the edge of the world
Here we are, trying hard to save our soul
So here we are, feeling nothing can stop this war
Fighting, running, kicking people to the floor

But sometime's hard to say if we are losing, winning
How can you tell?
Be right or wrong
Reality seems to be made up of
Differend shades of grey

Life is...

Black or white
You have to choose your side
We will fight
No matter if it's
Wrong or right
We'll ride the lighting
Day and night
Until we will be winning

Here we are, feeling right on top of the world
Here we are, feeling mean right to the core
So here we are, asking for an end to this war
Hear the enemy is knocking on the door

I can't remember one day with no fever
I can't remember one day with no car
I feel alive in I feel like a road king
I never slow down, I'm in paradise

Honey, honey you're my lady
I'm so happy driving in you
In the night I feel lonely
When you smile with headlights

Never blue, never bound, never cool, never down
In my supercar
I go west I go there, I go fast everywhere
On my way to Mars

Motor is running, gasoline is burning
It's like a heartbeat drumming in the hood
Tires on fire showing your desire
Now you go crazy, I got crazy too

You took my sex life with you
You took my sensuality
I curse the ground you walked on
The place that you belong

Bittersweet, like your tender lips
Killing with a kiss

Can you tell the mess you made
I cannot forgive you, I can hate
Can you feel the pain you gave
You left a broken heart

Dark and bright my share of pain
Dark and light run in my vein
Sun can shining
I can running fast
Move away from you

Dark and bright the gloom I feel
Dark and light it seems so real
Like a shadow
I can disappear
Run away from you

You took my loving away
You took all my self esteem
I can't see nothing but rain
My heart is melting down

Hurt me in, Hurt me in the dark
Playing at my back

One, two, three, here comes the danger
Love's not free it's not a legend
I can't stand into the fire
I can't wait my burning love goes

Fightin' for the right to live my
Life the way I feel
Waiting for the weapon then I'll
Shoot him to the heart

Love Killer (oh oh oh love killer)
In my dreams I feel like a rambo that killed the
Love Killer (oh oh oh love killer)
And the world will scream to me louder so happy

It destroys the generations
It is like the radiation
To the core I'll put my finger
For the shore we swim together

All my body' moving on. Music go
wilder
Like a lion in the night searhes for
hunting
All you people in the fight waiting for
starting

Let the music go no! no! baby
that is not on fashion
'Come on, come on ride the tiger
Let the power flow. Ye! Ye! baby
That is like a radiation
ready for you

Music go wild. Music go wild
Come on over
Come and dance it.
Music go wild. Music go wild.
Feel the fire
You can make it

You can feel it over all music go
wilder
every day I see the crowd gonna get
crazy
You can feel it in your heart music go
faster
Everybody's screaming loud let's go
ready.

Jump up and down
Gonna do it around
Don't ever stop until you drop
Love is a game
Gonna make it again
I'm your one night lovin' man

You can't stop me
You'd better like it
Live up your dream
So let's make it real
I'm your babe
Please don't say maybe
Let's make love tonite

I'm gonna be your toy boy
I wanna be your toy
We stay together
I'm gonna be your toy boy
I'm gonna bring you joy
Let's play forever

Down to the ground
Can you hear that sound
Coz it's a crazy melody
I'm what you need
I am your fantasy
Baby just don't waste my time

I saw them dressing like a heavy metal band
and even more
I saw them acting like a heavy rock militia

Then I heard their sweet and lovely songs
I heard their beat to come along hey! hey!
But what the hell is that ?
It's like a wannabe bes jam and I'm full of...

Rock'n' roll emulation in dance tunes
Rock'n' roll imitation in trance rules
Everyone wanna be a rocker
Everyone plays guitar
I'm full of...

They rented all the best musicians of
the music market now
They wanted to be tough and
make the sound more rocky

Leave
I'm not gonna stop you (stop you)
But before you go
Hurt me so I can't forget you

Say it wasn't love
Say I was a fool
Anything to tear me apart
Why do you care?
Why do you smile? 
Why are you holding me now?

Kiss kiss kiss
Kissing you one more time before
You walk out that door
Wishing behind these lips oh baby please stay (please stay)

Now you know I'm me
Looking down the street
Thought I could handle this moment
But your love was good
So so so good
And it's too much to lose

Miss miss miss
Missing you as you turn around
Walking out that door
My heart is crying out oh baby don't go (don't go)

No
I won't tell you so
Or that I love you (no, oh)
I've gotta let you go
(goodbye)

My life 
meant nothing to me 
then a guy like you came along 

Everything 
is moving so fast, 
I gotta get my feet on the ground 

Unhappy days are over 'cause I can 
always be with you 

Lying in your arms day by day, 
makes me feel Ohh... so brand new 

Can't stop fallin' in love 
Tell me you will be true (forever baby) 
I just can't stop dreaming of you 
everyday (every way) 

Say you love me baby 
Say you will always be mine 
You'll never break my heart 

I just can't stop fallin' in love 
Baby you became 
Makin' love with you 
is all I wanna do, (wanna do) 

Can't stop fallin' in love 
Give your heart and soul 
Stay with me this time 
And we'll make history, (you and me)

Can't believe you are here, it seems like a dream
What will you love hear my eyes, you'll never consult this to me
Still so long that now, like here like by my side
No how you really feel, baby please never let me go

Baby let's love love love again and again tonight
everything so right

Then the two of us can remember the sweet sweet love

Love Love Love Love
Love Love Love Love

Baby let's love love love again and again tonight
all the night make it right
stay the whole night right through like here by my side

Love love love again and again tonight

You only you who knows how to let me so right

Love again tonight

Baby take my hand I'll take you to the promise land
Running in the dust just you and me
A dream that must come true

Who's gonna ride you wild horses tonight
I wonder who's gonna take care of your lovely heart
No one to blame if the world shut the door
To people running like us fighting for love

I'm gonna love you desperado
You're running like the wind someday my heart will mend
I'm gonna love you desperado
Because you're wild and free the way you got to be

Get up off your kness there's someone that believe in you
Baby you can see that at the end you found who loves you too

It's the best of my heart
What you feel deep inside
And it means you better stay behind
my love

It's the dance at your soul
That you try to release
Never unchain your hot emotions
Feel it feel it babe feel the fire
Is burning deep inside me
Listen listen honey listen to
Drum is in to you
Dance to the

Heartbeat woh oh oh
You better take your chances right now
Dance do the
Heartbeat and let it go
Seek the power that in your body flows

It's the sound at your heart
That you hear deep inside
And it means you better change your
plans right now

It's a whisper of life
That you try to believe
Never give up without defending

It's every time I look at you
I feel I can't get blue
And every time I see your eyes
I'm gonna feel alive

I'll remember this when I'm alone
Far away
And when I can't get back in my mind your lovely face

I'll remember why I love you
In my endless lonely days
I'll surrender in your bed too
'Cause I need to play your game

It happens when you're not with me
I just can't feel the love
It happens and I need to leave
I need you on the phone

Next century is coming and I feel it will be wonderful
Even if I know the planet is needing help and love

To make a dream real it's not a big deal the only thing you really need is dreamin'
... so make it easy, so make it happen in the next new year
... so come on! so come on...

Love in the forthcoming century
Brand new feeling and way to live
While the clock of your life goes on
Get all good works and make'em done

Here comes the date, here comes the century that must be wonderful
Even if I know the planet is needing me and you

Don't hide, don't you go there
Don't even try to tell me i'm very sick of you
And there's no places we can go for better

Even if you think we're fine
I can feel the lack of honesty, baby
Even if you kissed me sweet
I can take it any longer
It's like a minimal love, faster and faster oh! yeah!
I know you need time
But you go breaking my heart deeper and deeper
I don't want to wait for you anymore

Ok, yes i got you this is your way to love me
But now i know it's not the way i wanted to be in a courtship

In this tunnel of love I am lost I can't find out the way to have you back
But you're so far away, day by day I can't help my heart cries, for my love

Can't stop loving you
I call you everyday come back to stay
Can't stop loving you
I need you with me night and day

Something in the night, I miss
I need to have you more than ever
Something in the night, a kiss
I dream to have you once again, close to me

In this tunnel of love, in the dark, I am looking for you to have you back
Someone give me the light I can fight with a lioness heart for my love

Don't be lazy baby.
Can't you see you're crazy? Baby.
I'm like a voice inside you.
Get up! get it all up!
All right you can really do it!
I'm like a choice around you.

It's your life and it's your time and there are no quarantees at all.
If you miss it, if you skip it then life won't give you another chance.

Live it up! Live it up! What you wait for?
That's the time you need salvation!
Give it up! Give it up! Stop your work now!
It's the night for restoration!

Up down all the time and 'round, 'round in a room and... listen:
You're like a dead man walking.
Stand up! Look around you. Watch out! Don't be foolish. Got me?
You fell into the death row.

And every time I think of you
Babe, I feel so blue
Cause you're so far from me
Tell me, darling, what went wrong
And I will sing this song
Until you come back to me

It's never too late to find a new way
And let our feelings back in time
Together again we'll stay 'till the end
Baby, hear me say

You're my... angel
You're all I'm dreaming of
Come back into my life and be my love
Angel, you make me feel so high
Come back into my heart
Come back to me!

Oh boy, you're really all I want
How could I be so wrong
To let you walk away
Tell me what I have to do
To get you back into my lonely broken heart

Come on everybody!
and Get on the floor

Techno, rave
Its time to make a stand
N pave the way some might say
Let it go, stay with the flow
Stay on bead, move your feet
On concrete
Or on the dance floor
You want more than I'll give you more
If its too hard core
Let me know
I stop the show
Then bring it back to be exact
At 12 o'clock rock the spot
Its to damn hot
They told me so
DYNAMITE RAVE
Its on the down low
Use your inner glow
To make a move show n prove
The man with the lisp
Sounds so crisp
When you can see me on TV
On the radio
Here me blow

I don't wanna give up
We're gonna have a party
Have a really great time
Yeah Yeah! just feel the beat
Listen to the music and feel that beat

Jump jump do your thing

Try to sing
Narrator king
Spread your wings
Make your head ring
To this song
All night long

To this party

When you strain
Don't be frame

Until you drop

I don't wanna give up
We're gonna have a party
Have a really great time
Yeah Yeah! just feel the beat
Listen to the music and feel that beat

I can't tell what I feel when you look at
me in the eyes
Deeper and deeper

I can't say what I wish when I see you
around my bed
I just can't tell you

Body talk language walk
I wanna keep you forever
I do need your
Body talk sexy shock
I couldn't have it without you
Is wonderful and

This is the way you love me
I can't believe is going on every morning
Is beautiful and

This is the way you kiss me
How many are the kisses you've never
gave me?

How can I stay the night if your perfume
is hot for me
Over and over
How can I play your game if I know you
will win for sure
I just can't run it

Into the light I wanna see you
Into the discotheque I wanna go
Just tonight
With you
When the light is on fire you'll come

On the floor
To be shine
Your eyes into my eyes baby come

You must be dancing

Welcome back baby to the disco fire

Into the night I wanna get you
Into the discotheque I wanna dance
All the night

When you
When the light is on fire you'll come

Now I'm searching for a passion in my life
In my room all alone
In the middle of the night

Rainy days without the rainbow
Storming weather in the sky
Without love and without passion
Without losted paradise

All alone my heart is breaking
All alone tonight
Looking for my losted love
Waiting for you so tendly

All alone my heart is breaking
Please don't make me cry
Looking for my losted love
Waiting for you my lover
Sweet and tendly

Lovely promise for one kiss

Dashing through the snow
In a one horse open sleigh
Over the fields we go
Laughing all the way.
bells on bob tail ring
making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight.

Oh jingle bells jingle bells

Oh what fun
it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh, Hey!
Jingle bells jingle bells
Jingle all the way!
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

A day or two ago
I thought I'd took a ride
And soon Miss Fannie Bright
Seated by my side
The horse was lean and lank
Misfortuned seemed his lot
He got into a drifted bank
And we we got upsot

A day of two ago
The story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh
He laughed a there I sprawling lie
But quickly drove away

You're free to go you're free to do it
You're free to blow everything we made
All that I need today's your understanding
Yes, it is

Well, there's something else that I can say to you
Hell, you better hear you better listen to
What I feel

Don't let my love disappear everything you'll be then
Don't let the time do it's work
If you're in that mood you don't know what to do
don't let my love disappear everything you'll decide
Don't let my heart slow its beat
You can think about anyway anyhow

No baby, you don't know you have to learn that
No baby, you can't get what's our feeling
Women and all about's totally different
Yes, it is

Takumi-bring me to the top

Blown round by the wind 
Thrown down in a spin

I gave you love I thought that we 
Had made it to the top
I have gave you all I had to give 
Why did it have to stop?

You've blown it all sky high 
By telling me a lie
Without a reason why 
You've blown it all sky high
You, you've blown it all sky high 
Our love had wings to fly
We could have touched the sky
You've blown it all sky high.

Up round I've flown then 
Down, down like a stone

Baby I lost her and she'll never come back
Help me I need a help now
Come on my lover all the time you cover
My body with your power and kisses

I'll be crying but I need your love protect me
In my bed out of my head
My honey can't you hear me tonight

Baby now I'm calling for you
I am burning
S.O.S.
Why can't you hear me...
Now I'm gonna tell you my love
I'll send to U... Another S.O.S.

Baby I tell ya, she will always regret
The day she really lost me
I was her lover ready to discover
All that she really wanted to give me

I've got the power baby
I wanna push you up
Let's spend the night together
Get another chance!

Hot for you tonight
Baby I'm gonna turn you on
Oh, you make me feel like a prince
Hot date with you... now

Black is the night and the sun is down
Oh babe come over me... I'll burn you out
Step on the gas 'cause I've lost in my mind
Come on and try for a while to make me shine

Black is the night when I lose your love
Oh babe come over me... I'll lift you up
Gimme your soul and be back in time
Come on and run to my den and taste my love

Don't leave me alone, oh babe
I wanna kiss you now
This time I'll come to rock you
'Cause I love you girl

Competition
New emotion
I am ready to win the race
Like a shiver
To my skin now
Baby get me power today

When I'm driving in my car
I feel the glory, baby
So I can't run without you
I need you!!!

C'mon baby, light my fire
I'm gonna take you to the speed of light
Take me higher my desire
We're gonna reaching the speed of light

Get me started

Ready to discover my dreams
You're amazing
Like a woman
With your power I gotta win

Speed of light, the danger it's my life
Speed of light, we can reach the sky

Livin' on the border
Always stay a step behind
Let me go try harder
Take a jump into the light

Now it's time to call for my play
Show the world I'm bold
I'm the one and there's no dull way
Come on up and let it roll

Burn into the beat
We can turn our life to golden magic
Burn into the beat
No regrets and no return
Burn into the beat
You can tear this spiderweb you're in deep
Burnin' let it burn
Let me burn into the beat

Don't forget this feeling
Tell me can you hear the sound
Drummin' like a heartbeat
They can lift me off the ground

When you come near I start to feel the fire
Rise higher and higher
I love the danger and I love desire
I'm burnin' for you

And when I find you dancin' by my side
I know I got no place where I can hide
And I got the flame so deep inside
Dive into the feelin', I feel the power

You burn me up, you burn me up
Touch me, don't shiver
Jump into the fire
You burn me up, you know the way
Deep in the flame of love burnin'
You burn me up, you burn me up
Sweet and so fender
Sexy lips on fire
You burn me up, you know the way
High in the flame of love, burn me up

Don't go pretendin' that you never saw me
No feel for your lovin'
Can't play forever at the game of feelings
I'm hungry for you

Out in the city lights
Feel of the dirty king
Got nobody to call or find
Just wanna feel free, girl

My wheels splashin' the black rain
Screamin' loud to hide the pain
Drivin' like a devil in the night
Down the city limit feelin' right

Ready to feel the power
And survivin' all the danger yeah, baby
Come on and feel the power
Every minute of my life is flyin' out

Ready to feel the power
And I wanna fight the tiger yeah, baby
Now can you feel the power
Every minute of my life is flyin' out

Streets where I wander wild
Mike after lonely mile
Still uneasy to stop in time
I'm feelin' the heat, girl

I'm never callin' "game over"
With seeds of fire and danger
You feel I'm back, with a shake and shiver
Go fly to the door

In the dark
Feel the power rockin' over your shoulder
Breakin' out from the ground
Baby keep on runnin' 'cause the hurricane's over you

Hurricane
Baby I'm a hurricane
Hurricane
Nothing ever stays the same
Baby keep on runnin'

The bells are callin' to shelter
The clouds are screamin' my anger
You know I'll find you where you feel safer
Shake top the floor

I got a feelin' tonight
I just wanna be crazy
In my mind
All the rocks into my life
Are like driftin' out of time

Freedom in the night
No stoppin' me baby
Freedom to be wild
This time is forever

Freedom wild
I've got to be mine
Follow my destiny
Destiny
Freedom wild
This feeling inside
You wanna fly close to me
Freedom wild
I've got to be mine
Oh baby talk to me
Talk to me
Freedom wild
This feeling inside
You wanna be the one tonight with me
Freedom wild

Ride to the city of lights
I'm breaking out babe
It's my life
All the pain I feel inside
Is a fire in my mind

People say, baby, I love danger
I go never face defeat
Down inside I just feel a stranger
Ridin', ridin', ridin'

Lost back in town, walking down
Crossing streets inside your heart
Turn around and face it
Never take a chain my soul

Mission impossible
Easy and simple, go!
Feel it loud or I can't feel love
Mission impossible
Ready to hear the call
You can never beat me down
Mission impossible
Easy and simple, go!
See the light on the storming sky
Mission impossible
Ready to hear the call
Baby won't you stay the night!

Healing pain, baby, it's a heartache
I say better get away
Sure I know I will love forever
Freedom, freedom, freedom

Ice into my brain
Where you come from baby
Heaven maybe
Fever in my body
Follow the light
Into the wheels of fire

In the sky - thunder
In your eyes - angel
I can see the flame
Burnin' baby show me the way

In the sky, in your soul
I wanna be there, I want to survive
In the sky, in your soul
Is where I belong tonight
In the sky, in your soul
I wanna be there, I want to survive
In the sky, in your soul
Is where I belong tonight
In the sky

Stuck into my mind
Like a knife you hurt me
Sweet like danger
Flashin' out forever
Runnin' tonight
And never stop your power

In the heart of desire
Burns the spirit of the night
It's a magic passion
Ever drivin' you too far

Feel it now
Feel it now
Precious like a danger of a secret love
Take a ride
In your mind
I wanna see you raise your banner so high

Feel the spirit of the night
It's a power deep inside
Let the spirit of the night live on forever
Feel the spirit of the night
It's a power deep inside
Let the spirit of the night live on forever
Spirit of the night

And it's really do or die
And you know you got to rise
It's a fire burning
Ever dancin' in the night

Everybody goes to the show tonight
Everybody's looking around alright
Everybody's gonna be petrified
Someone in the crowd will be killed tonight

Chase the lady
Japanese baby
Get the diskette
Let's go, come on!
Get the power
Use the gunfire
Stop the lady out of control

Super cops, here we go, Tokyo strike force!
You, never break the law, we've got the power
Super cops, powerful, Tokyo strike go!
We have to fight the crime, we're watching you

Won't you come with me to the fashion show
Many many models tonight let's go
Tell me tell me... What a confusion now!
Everybody's terrified all around

Never did that feelin'
Ever taste of lovin'
Can you feel the rhythm, my blood run faster
Now it's getting bigger
Burnin' all together
Lookin' like a magic, it breaks my power

Listen baby dancer
I can be your love
Lost into the night
Let your spirit fly
All you get is all you need to know

Baby - stop lookin' back
Don't turn around until it's over
Baby - stop lookin' back
And I'll forever be the one
Baby - stop lookin' back
Don't turn around until it's over
Baby - stop lookin' back
And I'll forever be the one

Baby you're my fire
Flames are gettin' higher
Surgin' to my feet I just toss and tumble
Jumble all my feelin'
More than I could dream it
Will you take my hand if I ever sumble?

Rocking to your baby
Now you gotta make it alive
You gotta make her feel it
Tell her she's a lady
Which is making you feeling right
And so you can believe it

Gonna celebrate
I gotta fly away
Coming back into my life
Somebody's dancing for me
Everywhere I feel a universe around

Big bang rocking away
You can feel again into ya baby
Big bang I wanna say
Going down falling down no more
Big bang rocking away
You can feel again into ya baby
Big bang I wanna say
Like a universe born from love's big bang

Nothing can be better
Nothing when I'm playing with you
I'm gonna feel the power
I can be a thunder
I can fly again in the blue
You see my heart is freedom

Gimmie the night my baby
I'm ready to love
Gimmie the time to fly
I'll give you my soul
and I won't let you go

Ready to love

Walkin along I see your face
The Number One that I need
All of my life inside this place
Wanna take your hand and fly away

Like a dream that I keep here in my soul [is "heart" on 2nd]
It's a fire burnin' through me
Every time that I kiss your lips
I can stop the night
Keep myself alive

Gimmie the night my baby
I'm ready to love
Can you feel my energy
Gimmie the time to fly
I'll show you my heart
Yes I know for sure all night long

Gimmie the night my baby

Dancin' along I feel your breath
And I cannot keep my tears
All of my senses free to live

The song is right time is making it tight
I wanna sing it to the world
For she gotta know that I gotta get on
I'm movin' things around me

I want you know I need you
You got to give me 'nother life and believe
The time is now the dance is now
Let's party,

Got a burning fever I am gonna give her
All the storm and thunders of my love
Got a burning fever feeling like as hiver
Getting me to lead you to the start
Got a burning fever flowin' like a river
Leaving me the passion of your heart

As you can see I will fight to be free
By taking out my voice and heart
For my girl is cool and she stick to the rul
Of loving no one but me

Oh, this is the night
It's a beautiful night
And we call it bella notte

Look at the skies
They have stars in their eyes
On this lovely bella notte

Side by side with your loved one
You'll find enchantments here
The night will weave its magic spell
When the one you love is near

For this is the night
And the heavens are right
On this lovely bella notte

Run wild, my feelings ragin' inside
Tonight I've got no way I can hide
One flash of emotion can be too late
To stop your devotion, don't hesitate

My heart is still untouchable
Can't take it prisoner of love
My fire is unforgettable
Burnin' up this rebel soul

Runaway, deep in the heart of thunder
Not for sale, so gotta run for cover
Runaway, this is no time for lovers
Come tomorrow, gotta keep on movin'

Runaway, deep in the heart of thunder
Not for sale, I'd better run for shelter
Runaway, this is no time to wonder
Come tomorrow, gotta keep on movin'

Your love for me's the sweetest revenge
Why can't you just get ready to change
No way you can dress me up for the show
Still feelin' a stranger, longin' to go

All night long
Dancing on the street

The loneliness
I fear to miss you one more time
I guess, I wonder
If you come back and deny
Of making love all the night
I need you lead it

I feel like a dreamer
When I feel you close to my heart

If you love your freedom
Okay, baby... I'll let you go

And I love the way you're spinning around me
Look me deep inside, I'm feeling blue tonight

And I can feel whatever I had dreamed

If you stop me, baby
Now I will get into my car

'Cause my head's on fire
So I'm running to my house

I believe in you, baby love is my fever
Deep into my soul, in the heat of the night

Hey, tonight I'm gonna love you twice

Double U, Double U, Double U
You love me

Never let you down, maybe I'm just a believer
Wanna hold you tight, in the heat of the night

Two in mile walking
Met a ballad singer
Who told me I'm like your wars
With boundry lands

Me, the lagic glory
Me, the logic story
Pull away from magic
And romantic place

Riding my white horse, something free
Shoot and take me to far away
Through the magic moon dark, find your door
Help me honey, show me the way

Lose your fantasy
And let me come
Into your kingdom through the night
Lose you fantasy
I'll be your Cinderella
Baby, you slip on me
And get me over and over

Wild boy
I'm gonna take around my sexy
Night toy
The music all around, you gimme a chance tonight
Baby, hold me tight, yeah - yeah

Like a dancer on the wire
Spinning like the fire
Make my dreams come true
Take me to your heaven
Countdown to eleven you fly
Come on baby, ahy - ahy, shock the night

Betty blue, baby you
Everybody movin'
Betty blue, baby you
Everybody walk along
Betty blue, baby you
Baby, keep on movin'
Duh - dah - duh - dah
Everybody sing a song yeah - yeah - yeah

Wild boy
I'll never feel the beat without you
Sex toy
Because I wanna be the night, oh crazy love
Take me to the top, yeah - yeah

This ain't a song for the broken-hearted
No silent prayer for the faith-departed
I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd
You're gonna hear my voice
When I shout it out loud

It's my life it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life)

My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said I did my way
I just wanna live while I'm alive
It's my life

This is one for the ones who stood their ground
For Tommy and Gina who never backed down
Tomorrow's getting harder make no mistake
Luck ain't even lucky
Got to make your own breaks

It's my life and it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life)
My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said I did it my way
I just want to live while I'm alive
'Cause it's my life

Better stand tall when they're calling you out
Don't bend, don't break, baby, don't back down

It's my life and it's now or never
'Cause I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life)
My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said I did it my way
I just want to live while I'm alive

It's my life and it's now or never
'Cause I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life)
My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said I did it my way
I just want to live while I'm alive
'Cause it's my life!

It's the time to look in
It's the time to look in my heart
In my days of rocking
In the days to rock of my life

Again... the music again... the lights on
Never ending town to town, landing to nowhere
Another show's gone, another bedroom
I don't wanna say no more 'do it for passion'

1 for the money 2 for the show
Yes I'm on sale tonight
Nothing to spell so right
1 for the money 2 for the show
I won't take no prisoners anymore

1 for the money 2 for the show
Yes I'm on sale tonight
Nothing to spell so right
1 for the money 2 for the show
I won't take no prisoners anymore

No more ways to walk on
No more ways to walk on alone
I got no more warnings
I got no more warnings to know

Don't you be alone, Hang up telephone! Come on!
Get up feel alive, get out it's your life! Get on!

Every day you're leaving behind you're
Approaching end of your life
Every step you'll take to the sky
you will fly and You won't die.

Let's go wild! Let's go wild!
We're about to make Love.
Screaming "Wow!"
Let's go wild! Don't be lazy, Come on!

Hey! You by the bar, Hey! You by the car. Come on!
Stand up feel alive!
Get up it's your life! Get up!

It's about the hot sensation
Not about their stupid tables on fashion
As electric hot vibration
Absolutely holy fascination

When I'm talkin' to you
WHen I'm on the roll too
Here comes the power
And burns the fire
Flows into the wire
Grows and gets me higher
Secret wonder

Electric power in my mind in your mind
Electric power every day every night
Electric power take me high make me right
Electric power master minder

It's a lock and roll inside me
Not a mirage not a "one time-wonder"
An electric shock around me
Stronger than atomic radiations

Welcome to my broken low
Welcome to the famous disco live

Come on lady come and go
Come on lady get me once and right

Rock it - rock it - knock to my door I'll open

Welcome to my rocky show
Welcome to the fire of the night
Come on babe let it go
Come on babe let me stick you tight

Once upon a time
Not so long ago

Tommy used to work on the docks
Union's been on strike
He's down on his luck... It's tough, so tough
Gina works the diner all day
Working for her man, she brings hom her pay
For love - for love

She says: We've got to hold on to what we've got
'Cause it doesn't make a difference
If we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot
For love - we'll give it a shot

Whooah, we're half way there Livin' on a prayer

Take my hand and we'll make it - I swear
Livin' on a prayer

Tommy got his six string in hock
Now he's holding in what he used
To make it talk - so tough, it's tough
Gina dreams of running away
When she cries in the night
Tommy whispers: Baby it's okay, someday

We've got to hold on to what we've got
'Cause it doesn't make a difference
If we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot
For love - we'll give it a shot

Whooah, we're half way there
Livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it - I swear
Livin' on a prayer

We've got to hold on ready or not
You live for the fight when it's all that you've got

Whooah, we're half way there
Livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it - I swear
Livin' on a prayer

Ready to be on top of the whole world
Ready to feel how hot beat is on board
baby you can be tought if you want it
Come baby come

Jumping and dancing into the fire
Pump it and knock it up plug the wire
Pcoking and rolling stronger than ever
Baby come on !

So blow up your music school
Grow up and make'em fool
Here is the truth and love
Really you can be right...

Onto the beat of my bang! bang!
Pick it up and move it on
Onto the beat of my bang! bang!
Shake your body on and on
Like a fiery doll

Dancing onto the beat of my bang! bang!
Falling into the deep of a badland
Loosing your faith and finding the madness
Go! baby! go!

My life on the speed way
My hands on steering wheel
Risk of racing in my eyes
As fast as cannonball
Engine's like a wrecking ball
Yellow moonlight in the sky

Push and never look back
Push and never give up tonite people say
All my energy and
All my knowledge are yelling loud into my brain

On my speedway in the pouring rain
I want to survive oh yeah!
When the pilots are just about to die
I like pushing

It's a speedway flowing in the veins
And I feel alive oh yeah!
When the pilots are just about to cry
I drive faster

Friends are waiting for me there
With no chances to know where
I will suddenly come from
Silent people at the beat
Pray the lord to drive me neat
And to lead me safe back home

Listen to my heart, listen to my love
I'm about to show up again.
Into the night clubs, into the right notes
I'll be back on rocking the fans.

I'm a survivor, I'm not a lier
You will see that, you'll be in it!
I got the power, I'm like a prowler.
Plug me in and go!

Super, Super Eurobeat!
For the mass and for a nation
Crazy for my song.

Super, Super Eurobeat!
You're the best, my name is Niko,
We are the wire.

Checking the mic now, switching the light on,
it's a feeling I can't forget.
Making the sound loud, breaking the walls down.
It's a shiver up to my neck.

In the night of thunder, all the people wonder
Who ever will come out? who will be the first?
In a darkened forest we came for a contest
We wanted to see cars whizzing in a burst

What a magic moment I can feel the vibe
What a strong emotion!
Praying for the wind to blow the gasoline
Wanna breath the action!

Night all around me I can hear the engine
Pilot is the hero
I'm on the road's side looking for the headlights
Ready for the thrill

Wood is really crowded, voiced are a hundred
And only the moonlight is the guiding light
In a situation full of competition
The favorite pilot drags us in the flight

Leave your Babylon, leave your Babylon now
Everybody's on, every one's on the run

Leave me alone don't get on my way stay away from me
Pick up the phone tell 'em not to stay
'Cause I am real

Superbad, no matter what you are
Not matter what you like, no matter what you do
'Cause I'm a...
Superbad,you better watch yourself
You better wishing well, you better keep me cool
'Cause I'm a Superbad

I'm the "Superbad", I'm a super bad boy
I'm the color red, I'm a dangerous toy

Shock! What we need is a...
Shock! What we need is a...
Rock! As good as we have never needed
Knock! What we need is to...
Knock! What we live for is
Rock! As good as we have never heard it...

Fighting for our rights
Never give it up
Waiting for better times
When we'll raise again
Shining just like a star
In the universe
Counting to four
One, two, three, four

We came for the rock, we came for the shock
Radiation that leaves you anymore
We came for the rock, we came to the top
And we'll never get back without your show

Rock! Today we came to...
Rock  Baby we came to...
Shock! As strong as you have never had it
Shout! Today we came to...
Shout! Baby we scream it...
Loud as strong as you have never heard it

Holidays and Honey Moon in September

Baby never forget my love
Never again
'Cause I know you're lonely even tonight

Could you be alive again

You... are in my mind and in my soul
Guess you'll believe in my tonight
I wanna show you all my crazy world
Oh be my lover!

Remember all the time

Keeping my heart alive... it's gonna last forever
Deeper and strong is my love for you
Can you be mine tonight... I wanna kiss you ever

Time, baby, has come and you will see
How much I love your pretty eyes
I don't wanna fool you, so believe in me
Oh be my heaven!

You and I, thinking of all the times we spent together. Everyday seemed to me, I like a walking dream, a picture of perfection But gradually, as time goes by, seems your love lost its lustre. With your eyes full of doubt, your suspicions aroused, your voices so full of tension. Recently you're been pouting, accusing me of unkindness. Tell me, how could you believe I would ever hurt you so please listen to what I say

I will protect you, don't you forget it, your love means the world to me girl. You are my angel, nothing will change that, your love is what keeps me strong girl. Love is forever, time is a healer, let's welcome the joy to come, girl. Deeper & deeper, sweeter & sweeter, together we'll build a future that lasts.

Losing sight of the precious things that made us special. Pretty quarrels all day, see our temper are frayed, rejection & depression. Clever words and conversation won't save us from this heartache. There's a far better way of expressing ourselves, I'll hold you oh so tightly. We're both been playing games, let's give this fighting a rest now. Turn our backs on the past, we'll forget all the pain, the good times are here to stay.

I know you!
I walked with you once upon a dream
I know you
The gleam in your eyes is so familiar a gleam
Yet, I know it’s true that visions are seldom all they seem
But If I know you, I know what you’ll do
You’ll love me at once
The way you did once upon a dream

A kind of emotion
I don't need a day into the wind
I'll find the solution
Right into my dreams

Tonight
You seem so far away, so far from me
Far from my senses, boy
Love is the message till the day will come, come

On my way
Don't play the game
You'll make me cry, sure will be so nice
In the night
We can get
We can fly
On my way

On my way
Don't play the game
Day after day, till the sunset way
In that night
We can get
Everything
We can fly

A broken illusion
You'll come into my life as the wind
You've shook my sensations
Dancing in my dreams

Nobody knows my name
I've just got into the party on my own
Everyone's trying to understand
My wishes and my illusions... so

Raising my eyes
Looking for you my love
Beating time... (the) music plays
I see the world... spinning around me

Let's have a party time
Night & day... get together
Here is a party time
You & me... take me higher

Missing your precious time
I wanna hold you tonight again, sweet love
Watching the sky I see the moon
I open my heart to you, babe

When I saw you again last time
You were walking alone...
What a beautiful man! right now
(I) don't wanna leave you lonely

Wanna pray (you) to forgive my sin of love
Can you tender again your trust and
You won't regret, I tell you the truth,
To follow my destiny

One day
more than I can pretend
'Cause I wanna belong to you
One day
We can be lovers till the end...
Listen me babe

I feel over the moon tonight...
'Cause I'll see you again
We can go for a ride downtown
Talking about the future

Say
You will come one more time
You will love for long
'Cause I don't want to feel the loneliness for you...
Play
Like a child one more night
And rely on my dream
'Cause I do want to feel your happiness and sweet love

I wanna see you
I'm crazy for you
The only man I like!
And I pray you like no other
To listen to me
Another time, boy!
I wanna tell you

Stay... together for a long time
Wanna say "baby follow my desire"
Just one night isn't what I deserve
'Cause you know, I want you for longer
Stay... together in a blue night
Let me say "baby follow my emotions"
One more night I just wanna be loved
'Cause I want to see you forever

Why
Do you take so much time
To get out from your den
I want to make your day and take you by your hand

Don't give up and look into my soul
'Cause I got something for you, boy
It is time to say : I love you so
'Cause we wanna live an endless love

Like a breeze
Come back to me now
You'll stop the time tonight
Because you're the only one who wakes my heart again
You will take me away

Even if you can't stay, see you the next time
Like the sun in the blue sky
You're living in my heart
The reason why you make me free
Like you baby
Even if you can't stay you gimme good times
Ever & ever baby
We can cross the sky
Your love is gonna fill the air
Like a spring time

Only love, I wanna give to you
It's like a magic event boy
We are waiting for the new spring time
'Cause you are givinig me an endless love

I feel your love
You really make me glad
I wanna give you forever my endless love
Forever (it's) spring time

(I'm) waiting my time
To see you again
Love is so deep and hot, man
Honey be mine
And show me your eyes
Passion is in my heart.

And I don't wanna see you just for fun tonight
Let me lead you to my heaven
Guess you can't believe in what you're gonna live
Baby come on! (I) don't wanna wait in vain you....

Follow your emotions and step inside my lovin'
Time after time you (will) lose your control and get me
Listen to me honey and step inside my lovin'
You will realize I'm crazy.

Tonight again
I wanna be loved
Shake up your mind and call me
(It) isn't a whim
My feelin' for you
(I) don't wanna tease you know.

Tonight, you listen to me for a while
This time I don't wanna give you my way
My life is slipping me out, so...
I don't want to feel blue again

Every time I will wanna be a star
(It) isn't so crazy!
I don't wanna stop my way
I feel ready! (it's) time to look for the
happiness

I just wanna live a sunny life
Never again, my love, I'm gonna be
sad... boy
Let me run away for a sunny life
I'm ready, not for you, a real life this time!

I know! you won't understand any word
You think I'm crazy to leave you again
But now I'm ready to drive me
By myself I can live my life, boy

Party is funny but I'm feeling blue
'Cause I think of you... oh my lover!
Babe I know that I miss your eyes
And that it's hard to smile... without your lovin'

Tonite... you are faraway
I'm feeling in love!
I don't wanna stay alone for long time
Now this is the moment to roll over and go back...

Suddenly you... like a star... I can't believe it!
Wonderful dream... side by side... for nights and days!
Suddenly you in my heart... it's fantastic
Let's celebrate... you & me, till the morning

Everybody's dancing up and down
Spinning round and round... magic moment!
Your recall is inside my heart
And I just wanna say oh baby reach me

Are you running away... now
Isn't a shame to leave... darling
I just wanna belong to you... so
Follow me soon and you will discover

Every time the sun is going down
The darkness surrounds me
I feel lonely
Every shadow is moving up to me
All around is like a nightmare

Honey, listen to suspiria
(I) shudder all over
Coming so deeper
Thunder in the night suspiria
Shaking me heavily
Driving me crazy

Love is keeping me clear and
Every light around... (is) shining
There's no rain in my heart right
now... see
You are so precious I wanna hold you

Do you know it's my time
I start to dream when I close my eyes
Then I cannot deny
I dream of you; (it's) gonna take me high

Now
Dream is in my mind
Take me in these times
Love is in my heart
Feel me now

Run to me
Cause you can take me all the times
Please don't be so shy
Don't you feel it now
Don't you remember when I said
You are like the hot Sunshine
Sunshine, Sunshine

Don't you think it's all right
If you can sleep, (just) you and me tonight
And my dreaming of you
Finally gets real: love is true

I don't want to recall
My love for you forever
When the tears in my eyes
Fell down with me together

Do you know?
And do you realize
How many lies (you're) telling me again?
Day by day
When I look inside
Can't see the way you could be my guy

Not far away I can resee my sorrow
By myself I've better take my way
Only sometimes you told me "I feel sorry"
(Now) I don't care you're fading in my mind

I remember the times
Of you and me together
(I'm) sad I too much for my heart
(I) can't cry the nights forever

Wanna belong to your heart
'Cause you make me feel
The happiness all around
And I want to shine this night for you... Just you

Never let me leave!
I'm ready to right your shady way of lovin' me
Tomorrow will be late... Oh babe

Do you remember sweet heart?
Come to me and love me another night
Wanna regain you, honey man
Once again I feel like shinin'
Do you remember sweet heart?
Light me up and take me another day
Light me up and take me another day
Wanna remind you to be mine
Once again I feel like burnin'

I wanna live in your soul
And believe again
That you can deserve my love
'Cause I want to play this game tonigt... Babe...

Walking the moonlight
And waiting for my time
I won't be afraid to lose
We'll be together
'Cause never and never
I will see my love in danger

And you can feel my passion
Don't want to miss you honey
I need to live beside you
Nothing's gonna break my heart 'cause you're my

Feeling the sunshine
Burning in my heart

And I'm gonna be there
Waiting for you, just for you, love

When I wake up the morning
I don't close my eyes
'Cause I know you're not leavin'
You can call me now
Trust me, I know this way
Don't you feel in your heart
Sometimes I want to say
Please believe me don't cry

Techniques of love
I feel sometimes
Babe I want you to know
Ready for love

When I seek for your loving

I'm not alone, oh no
Although it's never gone
Nothing my friend (is) so far away

Nobody else (but) you love in a bust time
Keeps my alive and bright for dancing

And time after time your body lies
Like an illusion like a fake, a bribe

And day after day show me the way
No way and never I will change my life

It's all the same old lie
It's only fantasy
You have to tell it right with honesty

I'm not alone, oh no
My heart is here with me
That's what I'm sure (of)
It's here to stay

Do you wanna know my funny life
Everyday I wait for you in vain, my love

Far away is your love (but) and I wanna be sure
To get into your soul and drive you to me
OVer and over again I wanna tender my lonely heart

Oh baby you know my way and I wanna say
How can you live inside my loving
Biding my time every illusion awakes
And keep my heart alive for you
Oh honey, you know my way and blue is the day
'Cause I don't see your little heaven
Taking my chance to belong to your world
I feel the rain inside my heart

You got power over me, my love
'Cause you know how much I love your happiness
I just wanna close my eyes and hope
To hold you till the end of time

Show me the way to fly
Open your wings to take me high
We can be love together
To reach the blue into the sky

Take me into your light
Open up your eyes
I just wanna stay in love with you
No more years away
No more rainy days faraway

Break into the love
Break into the night
Tell me when you come
Take me to your heart
'Cause our love is amazing
I need your fire, baby 'cause you set me free
...You're amazing...

Tell me the reason why
I feel the distance to you now
Don't hesitate to call me now

Waiting for your phone call
I just want to make me up
To be wonderful for you
And to feel alive

Everyday I wanna see your eyes
Maybe forever you'll be mine!
If you come you will be satisfied
Tomorrow will be late!

Before your heart'n body will be mine...
How many words baby
I have to say
Before you realize your love will fly...

Fighting forever

Are you loosing your mind, leaving behind
All that you gave me, please believe me
Don't want you to stay so better leave me today

You could be the one
Who's dancing in my wildest dream of love
I could be the one to say it is enough

I keep holding on and on
On a line of fire.
You ain't got me on the phone
Rising my desire.

Can't forget it, when you have said it: "you're my lady!"
I'm just ready getting so crazy.
Ring my bell!

Baby I won't let you go.
Baby I won't ever fall.
Gonna make you mine before tomorrow.
Every promise you have made.
All the promises I'll make.
Gonna make'em real before tomorrow comes.

I believe my heart goes boom!
I feel ike a bass drum.
I'm just looking for your van
Through my steamy windows

You won't let me go
I'll never forgive you
You won't let me leave
So far and away, 'cause I would die

Come on baby you won't turn me down
Listen, baby, I'll light your heart
I'll be ready for love one more time
'Cause I want you

Carry on carry on, I wanna go
Far and away with you my lover
Keep on driving to the ocean
We'll see the sunshine
Carry on carry on, I wanna fly
Far and away with you for longer
Gonna take you to the ocean
Keep on movin' this night

I will be the moon
The queen of a blue night
I will be the sun
'Cause I wanna shine just for your love

I'll always follow you me by your side
But you can't see I'm alone in this room
So far away

By now I feel like I'm reborn
I'll be fine
'cause my heart is signed

Woooo I think I like you again
Woooo I can't you see as a friend
Woooo This is the starting point of a crazy little love

Woooo I think I like you again
Woooo I can't you see as a friend
Woooo This is the starting point of a crazy little love

I'm laying on my bed
I watch the sky
But can't you see that I'm misunderstood
I'm waiting you

Be close to me by now
Because I want to see (this crazy love)
And follow me, we can be free
Don't leave me, I'm smiling again

Into my head
I got a message
Just for your vein
Because you need it

Drivin' in my car

Speed of my life
Out of control
I need a way out into my soul, oh
Why can't you see I've got to step away

Alone now, my world's in motion
My heroes are to the ground

Turn me upside down, boy

Dancin' alone tonight

Over and over I just wanna feel alright
Dancin' alone tonight
Out of your twisted life

Drinkin' in the sun, the light, baby
It's a wonderful paradise
I open up deep inside breath in
All is ready to move along

Feel a new go
Yesterday's been real hard to climb
Just let it flow
Singin' baby I'm alive
Give a new go â€“ heart and soul
Give a new go â€“ you take control
Down you let it roll
Stampin' on the floor
Dancin', sing it out loud
Give a new go
Give a new go

And I couldn't feel myself
Livin' in a mirror forevermore
All the word and all the time
Is alive and breathin' together

Workin' hard for love & money
Runnin' round for something funny
I don't mind the speed of livin'
Over the top of life

I wanna sing it
Scream it
Here I am and no denyin'
Louder
You feel like I'am feelin'

It's game, or just a story
Up and down, for love and glory
Stop and go, to give and take but
Right in the end it's me

I - I get so crazy emotional
No surprise - It must be all in the chemical

Every heartbeat
Every small feat
They can make me feel the light inside
Gimme that fever

An emotional child
You can love me or leave me
Risin' up with the tide
Fallin' down with the rain
An emotional child,
Looking up to the clouds high
Gone away with the wind
Livin' all for the night
Tonight

You - can see me thru so sensational
Must be why you look to me like your eagle-eyed

I wake up in the morning
The room is full of light
The train is just a warning
The rhythm of my life is callin'

I see the faces around me
A story told
I breathe the sky and I wonder
At this old world

I feel emotions inside me
I know that I'm alive
I feel emotions so beautiful
You make it all worthwhile
I feel emotions in my heart
In everything I do
I feel emotions so beautiful
And all because of you

No superman beside me
I know he's just begun
To make my days so happy
Not here just for the fun I'm feelin'

Baby, i first met you under flashes of light
Dancin' all night
Feelin so bright

Never never baby met a killer like you
See what you do?
Make me feel woooo

And i don't know how, baby don't know when
All i know i'm feelin that you feel the same
Happy inside
Watchin' the world in your eyes

La-la-la-la koi no yokan love

Namby pamby feelin'
Feelin' you will come to me
La-la-la-la koi no yokan love has
Gotta be ain't good enough to know

Second time i met you we stood out in the rain
Smilin' like friends
Lovers in chains

Can't remember time of night or day of the week
Godlike or freak
Couldn't believe

Everywhere it's boy meets girl
Everytime you feel the real thing
You believe it all an' all again

It's a turning of your world
And you're beamin' people all around
Baby it's a brand new day

But love is a pretender
Feel like I'm a prisoner of lies
And I must surrender
Tastin' all the bitter tears I cried
But love is a pretender
Boy I know you cheated all the time
All your words so tender
Cannot hide your ego down inside
Love is a pretender

I believed you were the one
Now I feel I was your clown, right?
And I know I've been a fool again

Baby you're so special
Gotta put a double spell on you
One for love eternal
And one more to make your heart so true

If I ever come to feelin' blue
Baby now I can depend on you
Heaven knows we got two sould above
Chimin' with love

Down inside you'll be my sweet forever
In your light I will shine
My sweet forever
Its divine dreamin' my sweet forever
I will crown with my heart
My sweet forever

Trust the first impression
And it surely got to grow on me
Now you're my obsession
What I did before is history

Crystal water fresh, all over me
Airy like the wind I wanna breath

I feel the beat, under my feat
Earth in my fingers
Fire that burns deep in my heart
Out of control

I'm countin' the stars, the moons I see risin'
You're my universe, the universe I feel in me
And lost in your eyes, I flow with the tide now
You're my universe, the universe I feel in me

Planets and the suns are all around
Heavenly like harmonies of sound

Everything is too confusin'
Round and round again
Everybody's waitin' for this
Two hearts' hurricane

Memories of love
Castles in the sky
Oh so high

Once upon a time it was you
Once upon a time it was me
Runnin' free
Livin' all alone
In our fantasy
Once upon a time it was me
Once upon a time it was you
What we've done
For this lovin', no
Never can be wrong

Everything is goin' somewhere
Back from start again
Heaven is on earth for lovers
Sunshine with the rain

Lay down your cool so powerful
You fashion boy
The beauty that's inside just let it show

Baby I know, no game we play
Don't you hide it all away
To me you're just so lovely as you are

Don't keep your love away, no
In the moonlight
Don't keep your love away, under
The sunlight
Let it all shine thru
I'll reach out for you
No-one else can touch us now
Don't keep your love away, no
In the good times
Don't keep your love away, boy
In the bad times
We just can't compare
It's a truth or dare
Baby can you hear me now

Gimme your smile, so powerful
You soldier boy
Believin' we're still fightin' in a war

Baby I know, the way to go
It's a higher jump inside
But that's the way for lovers, that is life

I know for sure the world can turn around me
Tonight I feel the earth is still
Can I be the only one?
Every little thing would make me wonder
If I could open my eyes and find

Everyone, everyday
Living just can break their hearts
So fragile
Anyone in their flight
Reaching higher, touch the sky
So fragile

A change of heart to start another feeling
The light of day, I'll change my way
Can I be the only one?
Every little thing would make me wonder
If I could open my eyes and find

Everyone, everyday
Living just can break their hearts
So fragile
Anyone in their flight
Reaching higher, touch the sky
So fragile

Another night the neon lights
Are flashin' on to the street
I feel the secret of this magic
Energy

Shape up to the feeling
Leave all the cares and the worries behind
We're rockin' and reelin'
Lookin' out to have some fun

We're livin' in the night
Like the creatures of heaven
I wanna take a bite of the apple for me
We're livin' in the night
Shakin' up to the rhythm
Turn the music loud for me

We're livin' in the night
Like the creatures of heaven
Let's play around the town dreamin'
What it could be
We're livin' in the night
Shakin' up to the rhythm
Got to feel alive and free

I want to cruise out of my mind
My shadows under the wheels
The funky dance of happy people
Waits for me

Rays of light are calling
Everyone around
All awake from sleep!
Everything is rollin'
Everything's alright
Can you feel it?

The sky is blue
I'm smiling back to you
I'll let my heart
Go wow and go crazt
Hey boy, a flower for you
Take me in your arms, we'll be
One and one together

Wanna be with you babe,
Can you feel got a magic delight
I'm your sunshine baby
Wanna stay with you honey
I can be every day of my life

Breathin' energy
Make a wish, forever
Everything's alright,
Can you feel it?

Listen now, gotta tell you something
I got my words all broken up
The truth is really achin'

You been so icy whatever comes to your mind?
Darkened beside me you maybe think I'm blind
I wonder what's become of us, in your dreams
I wanna shout in this silent night

Hearts on fire walkin' in the shadow
Burnin' feelings move inside
No hidin' away love

Hand in hand we're walkin' in the shadow
I just wanna be with you
Say never again love

Tell me now, all I know is sometimes
It's difficult to stay with me
So help me get this thing right

Sunshine of my life
See the sky smilin' so high
Sing a long, can you feel I'm with you

Forget all the world, in my mind
I know it's your love I can find
Rhythm of my soul
Alone and together
We're forever

2 Love
Can anybody feel the way I feel without you
4 Love
Say every day will be just fantastic
2 Love
I'm gonna be a part of everything that you do
4 Love
Hold me so close to your heart, 4 your love

Hot hot and so nice
With your skin smellin' my spice
I surrender to your gentle touch

Down down
Just like a yo-yo
Twistin' up a sweet romance
To, fro
You make my heart glow
Ready for bigger chance

And when we're close together, boy
Everything's so nice
You think I'm just your joyride merry-go-round
Round and round just like a

Yo-yo baby
Deep down 'n' goin' up
No-no don't go play with my love forever
Yo-yo baby
Roll down and wind me up
You got to hold me, and keep me and never let down

Be careful now, on what you say
Hear the voice, we push you from behind
'Cos you're not safe
From all that pain inside

I shout it loud
I'm making my own call
Let's get together boys and girls
Lost the day I was born
Point of no return
Now you're taking the toll

Generation of love
People try to get us sad and down
'Cos we get around
Generation of love
We can make the world
Just fade away, forever
Generation of love
I will burn until I'm getting old
But I'll die before
Generation of love
Is the flame that burns eternally
Forever

Weekend is on fire
Music get me higher
Ready to go out with my car and power
Keep the wheel in tension, get a new direction
We don't have the fear to drive tonight

Baby, in front of us the town is alive
Over the pressure it's neccessary
Push it down and bring the action

Master
The motor racing master
And you can't surrender
No one tonight can stop crossing the finish line
Master
The motor racing master
You don't feel the danger
Go now, the crowd is starting to call your name
You're the master

All around the drivers
Pray to be like tigers
Warming up the engine to high the power
There is no solution to make a revolution
You can drive so fast, more than speed of light

Now that the day is over
Sleep baby sleep
The night's for lover
Into my room
Under the moon
Dream baby dream baby
A new sensation began

I'll be your shoulder
Nothing better we can do
That live a life together
Only me only you
Only what we like to do

Nonsense sensation
Is like an overnight emotion
No matter what we can all go through
The number one thing is you

Nonsense sensation
You don't need any reputation
No matter what we can have been through
I'm your number one
And my number one is you

Now that the night is over
Live baby live
This perfect moment
Into my life
Feelings are high
Shine baby smile baby
A new sensation began

Baila, baira, baila morena
We can dance the night away
Spinning fast and light like a feather
With your Spanish eyes
You can drive a man to tears

Mi corazon is like a babe
I'm in your hands
Tonight yo quiero vivir
I want you dancing

Mira la luna
Nobody wants to cry
Tonight we go bailar
Two lovers holding forever
Mira la luna tonight

Bomba, bomba, bomba bonita
We can leave the past behind
For the future we can be leaders
You don't need no lies
I will take away your fears

You touch
All my deepest places
Too much
For my tender heartbeat
Come on give me a chance and let me in
Yo soy Bandido

I don't wanna be - Amigo
I just wanna be - Contigo
You're in my heart - Siempre
Mi Corazon - My desire

Quiero l'amor que nada priende
Quiero l'amor que non si intiende
Never give up on me baby
I won't give up on you forever


Quiero l'amor lo quiero furete
Quiero l'amor fin a la muerte
Never forget your face my lover
I wanna live my life together

You touch
My soul and my body
Too much
For my lovely lifetime
Come on take a chance and let it go
You soy tu chico

Here's a song for you
'Cause I feel brand new today
There's a rhyme for you
Just a present for your love

Take a play on words and more
And it easy fades away
Like a dream
That's goin' on
I can see the things I've done

Demons and angels and fantasies
To give your love some lovely feelings
Ghosts you gotta dance and sing with
Romance to miss too
When you just believe to more

I'll give you some love
I'll give you some more
It's just a COMMEDIA
(and I) feel so good

I'm lost in time
But that's all right
Believe in COMMEDIA
(Can) change your mind

That's my song for you
'Cause I wanna realize
What my love can do
Where's my loving flying to

Beverly Hills always in my mind
(I'll) never forget all those sunny days
When I was having so much fun that I still can't believe

Driving faster on the boulevard
And shaking up my hands against the wind
Walking in the streets of Hollywood
And later moving to down town

BEVERLY HILLS I will never forget
In every moment I would be there
BEVERLY HILLS this is my own regret
During the winter (it) makes up my mind

Beverly Hills still is on my way
When I re-think of my holiday
Having some rocking crazy night
On Sunset Boulevard

Gonna show you tonight
Because I'm feeling for you
Something I can deem good
Everytime you get crazy
'cause I don't go with you
Makes me so excited

Look me now, I'm looking like a big
movie star
I'm so shining
Listen now! I got to tell you what I
think of you
Look by my side 'cause

I'm in fashion
The king of the night
You'll see me in action
You're coming to me
And my directions
(will) Show you the way for running
Station to station

I will never deny
The love I'm feeling for you
I know you can feel good
And the time you will see
How good I'm looking tonight
(you'll) Buy me many flowers

All what you feel
Nothing to me
Your heart's gone through
I feel in love
(And) show you the way
I tell you

Time has come my love to tell you
I can't stay alone (just)

One more night
Just you and me
Falling in your arms, holding tight as
ever
Right, that can be nice
Even getting through all that day by
day

All what you say
Nothing to me
Your words fly through
I feel in love
That's all I'll say
Forever

Time has come my love to tell you
I can't stay alone (just)

One more night
Just you and me
Fillin' up your heart, feeling fine forever
Right, that can be nice
Singin' to your heart-beat
Music of the old days
Holding till the night is through

Tonight I'll give you all my love
And it's only for you
And I'll promise you my heart
And soul and it's all I can do

Show me the way
That we can be together
Show me the way
Honey we can be happy
Tell me the things
That I'm longing to hear
And we can be together
We can be as one

Wanna be my lover

For the rest of my life

Until the day that we die

You can see, I'm trembling for you and me

Everybody's looking for the same affair

Move it move it don't you stop groovin'

'Cos the music is there for something

Follow your heart
Right from the start
Anything but yours

Only when I dance with you
I can see we're moving right
And I find that good emotion
When I dance with you

Lost in your eyes, I'm lost in your eyes
Dance with you

To be there and fly forever
When I dance with you

Shake it shake it, if you don't get it fake it!
'Cos when you feel it

Listen to me, you've gotta listen to me
And try and keep up to get what I want you to do

It's not rosy, the days I've been through
Like an ant who is creeping on the sand
It's not easy, but I have to do
Like a bird who is rising from the land

Spice up! You can spice me
You just tell me I am the best
Spice up! You can spice me
You just trust me, trust me to the last

You are special, oh baby, you are special
'Cause you have something I need when I screw up to teach
Give it to me, you've gotta give it to me
I think I'm getting close to what I'm trying to reach

Living night

The heat of your desire
Made me feel too satisfied

My love came from Ibiza
The little paradise
I'm lost in your desire
You and me, let's feel the night

In the daylight
In the sunlight
Every summer night I want a man on fire
In the moonlight
Like a dancer
I will catch the eye on me
I wanna lose my self-control

Si la do
Baby, don't let you down
I am singing like a jingle in the rhythm of the night
Si la do
Baby, can't you let me down
'Cause I need it... need it... need it

I love to eat a pizza
I love it in the night
This is my good desire
You can go to satisfy

And if you like a pizza
Then buy it for tonight
You feel my bad desire
This is for my hot delight

One more time, I'm dreaming in the dark
Spanish melody is playing again in my head

Another day
I'm waiting for you
Another time
I'm feeling so blue
I close my eyes, I wanna be your emotions now
Incredible love tonight

I need a bang, shang a lang
Stop the music gimme love I need you now
Need a bang I need a man, baby

Never panic show your love and take me down
Need a fire in my life

Lonely nights, I'm freezing in the dark
Calling out your name is playing again in my head

This is a song for you
A way to say hi!
Goodbye to loneliness
Something new is out for me

Hear your voice on the phone saying
Time for movin' on

But sometimes you believe in love

But here you are, to open up my soul... wo-uoh...
I can't resist, my heart can't breathe
Lookin' for your eyes in the night

So come on, take a chance with me

You really hurt me in anytime
I was scared but now I know
That I don't want to hear your lies

But with your smile as an angel from the sky
You bring the light and you make me feel all right
And I'll be forever yours

And now my days had a change in every way
By you I know I will never be alone

And together we'll be one

Super superman
'Cause you're always there
Every time I speak to call your name
You're my superman
Won't you understand
I'm in love so deep with you

My friends they say that you never will be mine
I'm not afraid and I'm waiting for the time
I still believe you was made to be with you
What I want eternally

Can't you feel my heartbeat
Drumming to the feeling
Life's so free and wild
Oh you locked me up in prison
Say I've got no reason to leave

But love is shaking all chains
And if you feel that you're framed
Just change
To get away from this pain
I'll never turn back again
I'll say

Hello to freedom for me
Goodbye to love and to you
Baby let me fly away
Hello to freedom for me
Goodbye to love and to you
Baby that's no game to play

If you try to hold me
Tight to your sweet loving
Won't you set me free
Say you've got the key to my love
Then it must be iron and steel

Walking for so long
Round and round the city streets
Miles away from home
Time is flying away
Staring at the midnight sun
Love will find a way

Let's forget our sorrows
We've been waiting for so long
We will think tomorrow
About the meaning of these words

You take me higher
You're gonna set my world on fire
I won't give up anymore
You take me higher
I'm gonna show you my desire
I'll never leave you alone

Something is going on
Hopes and dreams are coming true
Since the fear is gone
Destiny is a game
We will play this game away
Love is not shame

Danger - a stranger - a new man is coming to you
I got the feelin'
Don't let it mate ya - inside you can see that it's true it needs belivein'

Let me see some real emotion
No - one runs for cover - give it some devotion
Let's give it a name baby
You know it seems I got the devil wantin' me

Kill the king
Baby I'll make you like a queen
Just be mine forever
Kill the king
Baby let's come together
You can be my treasure

Don't think it's over when night - time is finally through
Yeah girl I know it
When you're at home there's a new way of getting to you
And I can show it

I don't think it's over
I don't want another
Baby you're the one that took a part of me
All the things around me that keep to remind me
Every ittle moment passed next to you

And now there's nothing that I can do
To make you believe in all I say
But if you feel like I feel it's true
Say you wanna come back to me

Every time you go
I'm alone with my desire, I just can't get enough of you
Every time you go
I still burn into the fire, like I lay aside of you
Every time you go
I'm afraid to watch you leaving, I pray to never let you go
Every time you go
When you think I'm only sleeping, I can hear you speaking
Babe I love you

Once upon you told me
That you never hurt me
But I never really kept my faith in you
Now I'm here in crying just coz I was lying
Baby I will never be so bad to you

Go! For your life go!
Run until your heart feels the start
Then you go
Can be far from here, can be near
And forever

You fight to win
And you gotta win to show the world out
You are the best
You are the first
You can be just magic

It's only seven laps to go
But everything can happen
Take your life and make it alright now
Until the end
It's only seven laps to go
And you gotta feel it's magic
Go your way and make it your day
Until the end

Run! For your life run!
RUn until your soul gets to fall
Then you go
Can be everymore, can be sure
That forever

No reason to be blind
Walk along you'll see so

My reason to go on
My hope and sweeter dream

Love me now
You're my hottest fantasy to hold me now, walk next to me
Love me now
Synchronize in love and passion
You and me, in a world of magic and joy

Tell me baby why
Do you make me wonder
Why don't you come along
Waiting for so long
Running for so long
Baby won't you save me
I'm lost without your love
You can make me strong

Here I am
In the middle of the night
Now it's time
To read into your eyes
Where you will fly

Baby we just get away to get together
Fly so high and time has gone
I cross the nation we can fly
Come take it easy

Ace of spades
Wanna take you home
Love is like a game
Ace of spades
You gotta bleieve in the power of magic

You can dance
With the rhythm of the night
Can you hear
The echoes of my voice
Into your mind

Every night I call you, a paradise of light
Every day I'm waiting for you, I'm waiting for a crime
Deep inside I feel it, I feel it in my mind
Bad desire makes the people blind

Because my brain needs such emotion
Because my life empty I've nothing to lose
And this fever inside and this fever inside
Kills me oh no!!

Brother nightmare
Hungry for tasting your flesh your flesh
Welcome to my Brother nightmare
Entering you with a slash a slash
Welcome to my Brother nightmare
Welcome to my Brother nightmare

Every night I need you I need you for my life
Every night I kill just for you
I don't want ask you why
No one now can stop me, can stop this wish of crime
Now my life for you don't worth a dime

I wanna be just far away
From the lies you told me baby
There is a place in which I can
Live in a perfect life without you

The only company will be my shadow
Silent here at my back, shelter for all my lacks
Finally sure to be myself

Back shadow
In the dead of the day, complete my energy
Back shadow
No more fear of the dark, with you by my side
Back shadow
And it will be all right, here in the darkest night
Back shadow
No more reason to fight with you by my side

My only big mistake is you
Tumbled down into my time babe
I gave you love you gave me pain
Please now just get out of my case

Jump in the light
Don't you feel to fly
Until the sky
Take a breath and look it's blue
For me and you

C'mon spread your wings and take off
We are leaving now, we are ready
For a new blue horizon, lady

We are back to the rising sun
And the new day has begun
Oh you know this world
Back to the rising sun
Where clouds are melting in the dawn
Together

Out of the night
There's line of sight
Inside your mind
All the different points of view
Out of the rules

The stars above around the blue 
Cos I believe in you 
And I believe you'll find your way 
Thru all the lonely days 

I'll be waiting for your smile 
Waiting for the sun 
Everytime I see you cry 
'Cause you shine with your light inside 

A beautiful lover 
I want to know if you really can 
Give me your heart 
Tell me now who you are 
Till you get to me 
A beautiful lover 
I need to know if you really can 
Hold me tight 
So we'll fly to the sky 
If you just believe 
There is no goodbye 

I'll take your hand and understand 
The words you say to me 
Till you can see the world around 
Thru all your lonely days

You fight against mystery
Sending the knights of fantasy
Princes and kings are on your side
They will stand fight for the reign

I'll be there to protect you
Fate and love are stronger in your heart
It's your day there's a way to guide you
Now can't you see we'll be fighting

And I'll follow too
In the net, in my wire

A new world for two

Just wanna take my chance today
"Sitting in my car"

Another dream to survive

Fantasy car
Take my breath away
Drive me into my fantasy
I see the moonlight just on the road now
She makes my way

Leaving me here with nothing I know, but tears
But I'll play this game

Dangerous love
That is what you are, nothing more
Nothing but a dangerous love

And water calls my desire

Now

Are you ready to come inside
And you're gonna feel the engine
Are you ready to face the light

As I step into my ride

Win forever

Right to yoou, oh my darling
You've never never knew

You think you're stronger than me

You're the one, my darling
You're the one, I can call my love
You make my life shining
Just when I need someone to talk to my soul

So when I remember all the nice words
You used to tell me, don't ya?
Still remember the good moments
But something sweet is harder to forget

Sweet heart is such a little world
This lady just long to hear it
Sweet heart and you will fill my world

Living like a love song
And all I need a boy to threat me so right

Won't you believe in a tale I can say
Open your mind, baby don't be afraid
Don't you believe in a freak in the sky
Don't lay in my bed our children tonight

Take a nightmare like so real
In the mirror watch the fear
Everybody needs somebody
When you go breaking my heart

Just an illusion
Don't worry, my guy
No more confusion in my desire
Just an illusion
One danger in time
If you keep me, nothing you lose

Just an illusion
Don't worry, my guy
No more confusion in my desire

Nothing to do when the fear has gone by
You won't believe in the freak all the night

'Cause now that you're gone I lose my mind
Wondering with so many questions

I better choose to take the final step now
Can't feel myself and there's no turning back
No more stupid endlessly conversation
Face to face, cause my love is gone now

Take my heart and go
I don't feel the need for this kind of painful love anymore
No one's right or wrong
You will never love me 'cause you're just too hard
Too hard and cold

Take my heart and go
I don't feel the need for this kind of painful love anymore
No one's right or wrong
You will never love me 'cause you're just too cold

I gave you everything
Now you're giving me a good-bye
If I only could turn back the time
Wondering why I've been so stupid

I need your love, I fall apart
Break my heart
If I could go around the world in a day
I couldn't find another one like you babe

I gave you everything
This is what you need from me
I gave you loving, everything in me,
The reason why...

I need your love, you make me lonely
I need your love, I want you to want me
I need your love, my tears fall like rain
Ain't that a shame, you're the one to blame

I need your love, I fall apart
Break my heart
If I could go around the universe
I couldn't find another guy like you babe

You used to say to me
I was a girl so special
You used to say to me
You won't give me love
Because you feel I'm danger

Boy I am a bad girl
This is me, but you want me
I can break the whole world
And you'll give me your love
You know what I mean

Crash boom! Bang! Bang!
Tell me you love me
I know you're watching me now because I'm dancing

Crash boom! Bang! Bang!
Tell me you want me
I can feel how much you're looking

Crash boom! Bang! Bang!
Show me you love me
I know you're wanting me and my heart is pounding

Crash boom! Bang! Bang!
Walk up and take me
Watch out boy, your world is breaking

But you should never try
To change the way that I am
But you should never try
To deny my love
Because you feel I'm danger

And it's over one year
Since you went away
Still I'm sad and blue
It's not over, I fear
Since I am this way
I think about you

'Cause until my heart beats
Boom boom
I will never stop loving you
Can't you see your love hits
Boom boom 
I know the only thing I can do

I don't wanna stop to dance in the night
I don't wanna stop to feel this good vibe
'Cause life is short and no matter I try
I can't stop to think of youy
I don't wanna stop

And it's over one year
Since you changed your mind
Still I wait for you 
It's not over, I fear
Leave it all behind
Not think about you

Angel baby flying away
Won't you stay a little bit longer
Can't you see I mean what I say
Feel my heartbeat stronger and stronger

Freeze me with emotion
Every time you look my way
With your eyes you can steal my heart's devotion
You make me feel the thrill

Baby kill me with your eyes
At first sight
I got no defences you

Kill me with your eyes
Kiss me deep inside
Oh what a feeling

Kill me with your eyes
By surprise
See thru my pretences you

Kill me with your eyes
Kiss me deep inside
Oh what I feel is you

Stormy night is coming to town
And the city heart's like a jungle
Everybody's hunting for love
Feel the hungry hearts roll an' stumble

Every time I go every time you know
I will leave a part of me across the sea

Take your time and tell me if your love is still deep
and strong
I can tell you that my desire is forever
Sleeping with the little pink fluffy bear you
gave to me
I pretend I'm holding you

I wanna keep, I wanna keep it for tonite
I wanna have it when I see the morning light
But if you call, but if you call me to say hi
I'm gonna say goodbye and hold it, hold it tight

I wanna keep, I wanna keep it for tonite
I wanna kiss it 'till I feel the morning light
If you don't call, if you don't call me to say hi
I'll give a kiss goodnight and hold it, hold it tight

Baby wait for me baby stay with me
'Cause you know I need you more need you more

All night on the phone far away from home
Just to send you a kiss again say your name

I don't wanna hurt you but I need to talk
To talk about our love
I don't wanna hurt you but I need to walk
Walk away, walk far away from you and I......

You know I'd like to fight to give our love another chance
A new romance, keep my heart with you
Love is in danger (it) is gonna die
Love is the saver (it) got to survive
Love is in danger I want to keep my love alive, alive forever

I don't wanna stay but I don't wanna go
You got to help me now
Tell me if you need me or baby tell me "no"
Got to know got to make up my mind and I......

I've the strength to say no
Even if my heart is crying inside
See the people I know

Even if I only want to see him
Got to hold on - Stop the poison
Got to move on - Change horizon
Never surrender
I'll keep on searching for a...

New love
After the rain is gone
After the wave will was the shore
I'm gonna wait for someone incredible

New love
Takin' my heart brand new
Takin' my love but caring too

Hear his voice on the phone
Ancient memories and old emotions
I can live on my own
I am strong enough to face the future

8 o'clock in the morning
I get up while you're smiling to me
Another day is starting over
The sun will shine forever woaaaaoh

The people scream and run around in the streets
And life will flow like a stream
But I can't wait until tonight
When I'll have the chance to whisper once again

Hello hello goodbye I wish you have a good night
Another kiss to you again tomorrow
Hello hello goodbye the future looks so bright
Forget your pain forget your sorrow

Hello hello goodbye I wish you have a good night
Another kiss to you again tomorrow
Hello hello goodbye the future looks so bright
Forget your pain forget your sorrow

5 o'clock in the evening
Baby love I am running to you
Another night to spend together
Our love will last forever woaaaoh

Now my heart is out in the open blue
No matter fast I'm swimming to you
Man if you'd call me now, I will rush the shore
Oh baby keep on waiting

You're welcome all aboard, welcome all aboard
'Cause I am the captain of a broken heart
Load your love on board, load your love on board
Stow it in the belly of this sinking ship

Please baby take me out from the blue
S.O.S. to your heart, S.O.S. to your heart, oh yeah!
Please baby save me 'cause I need you
S.O.S. to your heart. S.O.S. to your heart, oh yeah!

Now my heart is out in the ocean depth
I'm slowly going down in the blue
Send an help to me, baby send it soon
I cannot keep on waiting

It's a rainy day
And I want to cry
I waslooking for real affection

But I save my tears
Holding all my fears
I'm a woman without protection

'Cos my love is slowly gone away this
time forever
I won't never fall in love again never
and ever

You promised me to love me for a life
you gave up
My baby shame on you

You promised the moon the stars and
the night you gave up
My baby shame on you
My broken heart now will fight to
survive you gave up
My baby shame on you
My broken heart now will scream in
the night you gave up
My baby shame on you

I won't ask you why
You told me good-bye
Every night you'll be my obsession

But I will survive
I will stay alive
I just wanna start a reaction

Rainy day I'm thinking about you
The things we say, the things we do
Is it real or fantasy
What's happening to me

Could I ever change the feeling inside
Heaven help me, I won't surrender
But I wake up with a scream
When you treat me like you do

Shattered dreams
Oh why did you break my heart
Shattered dreams
You leave when I close my heart
Just a little Crush
A little shake inside my heart
Why

Love is danger, love's a risky game
So far away who is to blame
When you treat me like you do
No more thinkin about you

You
Only you can make me feel this way
Only you can make me happy
Forever again
I will never change my mind
And the losing you

My emotions running to you
So much fun in these sunny days
Laughs and passion
Your affection's falling on me
Coming down from the sky
'Cos you're looking like an angel

And the beat goes on
Together we can make find a way
To play our love games
And the best goes on
Together we can make our day
And play our love games again

You
Only you can give me such a thing
Only you can light my fire
Forever again
'Cos I have your pretty face
Deep inside my heart

Just another day - It's always the same for me
I miss my freedom
I got to work today
But I got you always on my mind

There's a way that I can get through
Through all the work I know I have to do
It's all so easy
Remember you and me

I'm running out of time thinking of you
So many things that I want to tell you
Oh and I'm feeling fine thinking of you
I hope you're feeling the same think too

Only yesterday just think of the fun we had
You really showed me
How to pass the day
And now I have everything in my mind

Don't do me wrong
Do me right do me tonight
Don't let me alone
'Cos I'm not the one who plays the fool
Tonight I know you'll be again with someone else

My heart's divided, broken in two
I really don't know what to do about you
I'm undecided, go damn on you
You ain't gonna see me getting down on my knees

Don't let me be the first to say goodbye
I don't know I don't know if I can make it honey
Don't let me be the last to know about you
You told me lies don't hold me tight baby

Don't let me be the first to say goodbye
'Cos I know 'cos I know I can't take it honey
Don't let me be the last to know you're cheating
Too many lies I say bye bye baby

Don't say a word
Say goodbye say it tonight
And let me alone
'Cos I'm not the girl who played with you
And soon you're gonna be again with someone else

Every time I'm needin' your lips so nice
For ever and ever you'll be so fine

I know I'm always too young to love oyu

No matter changing my point of view now
Remember you can never feel what I feel
When I'm gettin' closer

For I will come to know

Jumpin' up and down the way I like

I guess I'm even too small to please you
No matter changing my way of life now
Remember you can never feel what I feel
When I'm getting closer

Oh baby where do we take it, how do we start

Love is like ageme, do you like this way?
Every night you take away from me your heartbeat
Do you know my love, was enough to you
Every kind of joy with you is like a mad time.

I can lie for you
Because I love you
Take my hand and go

Someone fade' away, from your eyes right now
Everyday I catch the time for you my honey
Running fast for me, you can take my heart
Every king of love in you still exist in my life.

It's just a dream I do every night
Over & over
It seems like a flash to me
I feel so good like (in) the same old song
(I) open my eyes
And feel like on holidays

When I see you spending time for me
I can't believe what I can see
When my love is magic, what to do
To love you?

Holiday, holiday
See you by the sea and sunshine
Holiday, holiday
Get away, relaxing all my mind

The night is over, I just take a flight
Ever & ever
It seems like I can be free
I'm feeling fine like I was before
You by my side
I feel like on holiday

I just need you, I love you baby
And tonight I don't want to stay alone
'Cause my body just needs your lovin'
I'll love you all the days of my life

I want you kiss me, my lover
Huggin' me with your arm all the night

You better understand the reason
That I need to talk to you
And I don't give a damn
How mad you get, this time you listen

You lay around in bed all day
When I'm in town just walking
I gotta run away today
I need a change

Boy, I got to run
Find me someone
Help me somebody I need a cahnge
Starting today
That's what I say
Tell all your friends I'm leaving

And I give you more or never try again
I got to live my life
The way I want, so understand me

Looking around, what's in the air
Tell me what you see
It's all around, everywhere
In the air we breathe

Smoke is the reason for the doctor you pay
Smoke is the reason everyone's choking
Think of the people smoking everyday
Baby believe me, I'm not joking

Now is the time for me to love my baby, oh
Now is the time I need to love my body
This is my own, a very special body
So now is the time for me to love my body
Fooling around up in the air
With the chemistry
Here on the ground, no body cares
Of the air we breath

I have been standin' into the fire
Waiting for my time and I got the fever
Sending my calling, I'm not a liar
Reading pages of economic paper

Over and over again
I tried to make you understand
That I'm ready now
Look at me babe tonight
'Cause I will be flashing
Over you

NOTHING'S GONNA STOP ME TONIGHT
I've seen a color better than rainbow
I'm gonna fly on through it
NOTHING'S GONNA STOP ME TONIGHT
The only chance to feel like a symbol
And I've got the ticket for it

I can't be happy working for money
Living like robot I had chances
Watching some people standing so lonely
I can see the reasons to be so different

Let's make up
I made a mistake
Giving my love to a stranger

Let's make up
Please give me a break
I can't believe how dumb I was

If you take me back
I wall dedicate my whole life

Baby thats a fact
I will remain true, yes I do love you

Give me ONE MORE CHANCE baby
Give me ONE, MORE, CHANCE like before
Give me ONE MORE CHANCE baby
Don't wanna beg no more

Let's break up
If that's what it takes
I put our lives both in danger

Let's break up
But please baby wait
I know your heart's full of anger

Oh, baby together we've never been
You know why I can't stay alone
I wanted as ever only to be with you
'Cause I'm feelin' so lonely

So tell me that your love is only for me
Tell me that you love me, tell me that you need me
Because your love is honey, you see
Shakin' up emotions, shakin' up sensations

One of these nights
I wanna be your guardian angel
'Cause you're in danger
One of these nights
I cannot be your lovin' angel
'Cause you're in danger

I'll show you the love that you've never seen
'Cause I wanna be your, my love
I care more than ever only to be with you
'Cause I'm feelin' so lonely

Only two weeks ago
I spent my life for loving you
And every boy I see
Reminds me what I felt for you

You can believe me
The reason you left me
It's hurtin' me one more time
I don't believe you
I'll never trust you
I know you betray sometimes

All my time I've spent with you together
Is telling me not to fall in your smile trap
Never trust the man who lies forever
I'm not gonna waste my time for loving you

I'm gonna live again
Without your love I'm feeling safe
You'll never be my friend
The loss of you is not disgrace

When I get up in the morning baby
After dreaming of you
I get hot and I get lonely crazy
Wishing you were here too...

Dreaming that you and i we were making love
Yes it was you and I just kissing huggin
You and I having lots of fun
Yes it was you and I just making love for...

So long loving for so long
Singing a love song kissing you all night
It was
So long that's how I like it baby
Loving you just make me crazy

You're the number one my only baby
Yes I'm talking to you
Please come over and make me crazy
I've been dreaming of you

When you walked out on me
Couldn't live in this way
You can't treat me too bad

Only you can make me all right
Don't forget me tonite
You can't trust me so high

Back in my life
You don't know you're my time
This is my affection, you know right

Burn in my heart
Can I tell you so fine
I can't wait, my guy

SO MUCH IN LOVE I'm fallin'
With you, can I smell your neck again
SO MUCH IN LOVE I'm living
With you, can I take your love forever

Someone says I love you to have
Easy lovers, I know
Without feeling or love

I can explain to you and believe
All my time is your time
With no lies to release

I can't live without you
But I've lost my faith every man
Every day I try to understand
If I am wrong when I trust anyone

Every night I'm here so lonely
And I don't know how to carry on
I can feel the life flowing in my veins
Is it a dream or is reality

But the way that I feel when I look at me
Baby is a storm that burst inside
And I pray you to take this pain apart
So that I never have to worry

I don't want to spend my life forever
Trying hard to find my lover I don't care if you are nobody Baby I love you so take me a way Be my tears in times of crying Hold me when the sun won't shine Baby don't forget about me Don't leave me screaming with nothing to say

Keep the music praying
Never stop the candle of our love
I ain't got a reason for the things you said
I can't forgive the lies they hurt so much

Every day and every night I need you
I don't wanna feel again the loneliness
I won't leave you sittin' longer on your own
Come on baby take a chance and call
me back

Oh man! what's come over you tonite?
Love can be amusing!
You told me "(I) wanna try again"
Are you ready for lovin'?

If I only knew to forgive your lies
I could feel alive... consider this!
If I only knew how to see your eyes
I should try again to fall in love with you

Baby listen to my heart... I love you
I don't wanna pay you back for leaving me
We can walk around together for a while
Let me see your paradise for once again!

You, you ware the one that promised me
The love that you give woudl only be
Here for the two of us... you liar...

Look at what you've done to us...
You tore us a-part like paper
Now I know you're nothing know you're
Nothing but a low - life fake...

Won't you tell me WHY?
Oh you liar...
I was true in my heart and you tore it to pieces
WHY?
Oh you liar...
Did you sell me the dreams to my heart and release it
WHY?

If, if you were me and I were you.
I wonder if you'd feel this way too.
I guess I will never know... you liar!

The distance between us, between you and I
Can seem so long - when I look at I
why it's not far
Can't be very far but not too close

I never say the things I want you (to) understand
I can't take no more of all the rumours at hand
Because boy we got the red moon shining in our heart

I was hoping somehow
That some body could step in and change the wind
But I decided no - no there can be no way
So I stand like a rock
And I'm feeling so strong and I'll never cry
Open the window - shoot at the town bang! bang! bang!

Won't you hold my heart Mr. Valentine
No no no your love don't make me small
Boy I wanna get lost in your pretty lies
No no no you know that I can't dance

I'm looking at the mirror - I see my face
What to do what to do
No matter how I try no way that I
Can't stay a little dreamy girl

I'm look at the clock and there I see the stars
It's already midnight the fever is on and I'm down
The love we have will never find it's home
We sit out the hours 'til the morning comes
The first thing tomorrow love is on the run
And I know it's not the thing I want to fill my heart

I was hoping somehow
That some body could step in and change the wind
But I decided no - no there can be no way
So I stand like a rock
And I'm feeling so strong and I'll never cry
Open the window - shoot at the town bang! bang! bang!

Won't you hold my heart mr.valentine
No no no your love don't make me small
Boy I wanna get lost in your pretty lies No no no you know that I can't dance

Won't you hold my heart Mr. Valentine
No no no your love don't make me small
Boy I wanna get lost in your pretty lies
No no no you know that I can't dance

I'm looking at the mirror - I see my face
What to do what to do
No matter how I try no way that I
Can't stay a little dreamy girl

Look at me - I wanna have fun
I want to have a happy life
And I know that there's a way that I can fill it
Full of joy

Don't you see it's like a medicine
Love makes me feel so new
Kiss after kiss
I feel you wash away the badness
That I knew

Take my broken heart
I need someone beside me
Won't you play the part of lover say that you
Would die for me

Take my broken heart
Oh now that I have found you
Make my life a dream
Say that you'll always need
Me round round you

Bad times gone - and good ones begun
Now it's gonna be alright
And there's nothing gonna stop me now because I've
Got you boy

Funny world for me
Don't you know I'm crazy
Baby don't be lazy
Get up and run
You are getting older
But I'm feeling stronger

Don't kill your dreams and no fear
Let's get away from valley deep!

Walking up and down
Rolling on the ceiling
Baby how you feeling?
And I will rock you
I will take you higher
I am not a liar

Don't kill your dreamsand no fear
Let's get away from valley deep!

A, B, C, D
Gone away my friends 
You too were singing out
Living the fantasy
A, B, C, D
You can hear the willful
Looking round your door

Baby you're not too afraid
Don't you believe in my world?
Won't you say
Don't you believe in my world?

Walking up and down
Rolling on the ceiling
Baby how you feeling?
Get up and run
I will take you higher
I am not a liar

Don't kill your dreams and no fear
Let's get away from valley deep!

Bad boy, bad boy you
Come and make my dreams come true
I need your loving really bad
'Cause you're the man I never had
Say yes, say no
Baby don't you let me go
Say I'm the boy who needs you so
Hey, come and get me bad boy you!

I am not complaining
If they're not the same
As not the other women

I don't wanna leave high society
That's not my kind I've seen

All the boys who call me to ask me for a date
Don't come back the second time
What I want is someone to stimulate above
With a fever in his eyes

Bad boy you (I want you)
Bad boy you (I need you)
Bad boy you (you need me too)

Bad boy you (just take me)
Bad boy you (and let me)
Bad boy you ('cause I'm the few)

I will never rest 'till I find the best
'Cause I an searching for you
When you come my way
He'll see me and say
"Hey baby, you're my kind!"

Following melodies
Sailing abound the seas
Trying to find a land.

My ship gets to the shore
I walk into your door
Can't you not understand.

All I want is love (All I want is love)
I cant get enough. (I cant get enough)

All I want is love (All I want is love)
I cant get enough. (I cant get enough)

So right is wrong to stand
Stay while I can feel your hand
I wished a dream would last.

Searching for lover nights
I find it through disguise
Sometimes I go too fast.

All I want is love (All I want is love)
I cant get enough. (I cant get enough)

All I want is love (All I want is love)
I cant get enough. (I cant get enough)

Come on, come on, come on, come on
Give a chance to desire.

Come on, come on, come on, come on
Give a chance to desire.

Come on, come on, come on, come on
Give a chance to desire.

Come on, come on, come on, come on
Give a chance to desire.

You are the one
I could reach for the sun
but you let me go higher.

I'll maybe believe when I
Find you wont leave
Give a chance to desire.

Walk in the night
I don't feel emotions
Lost in the dark
For all the rest of my life
I've no doubt, I'm losing your love, baby
I know, will be hard without you

Energy, to fill my body
Fantasy, I need you too much
Come on my love, I'm waiting for you
I want forget, don't let me down

(I say you) BYE BYE BABY
How many time will pass before we'll meet again
(I say you) BYE BYE BABY
My life is changin' from now on!

Give all my soul
To someone like you
But nobody else
Will be the one love for me
So I'll spend my time to drive people crazy
Will be harder explain without you

I'm feeling very sad
Every time you go away
I'd like (to) forget your name
Every time you go away
You take a piece of me with you
Every time you go away
I feel my heart is cold.

With (the) flight of fantasy
We two were made for one another
Love this melody
Would you like to sing forever
You're my lover in all my dreams
You're in all my tears.

Oh oh, I believe in a flight of fantasy.

Every time you smile I see
The passion in your eyes
Every time you make love
It's like hi energy
Every time you kiss my lips
I thrill of joy and pleasure
It's the greatest love of heart
A flight of fantasy
Flight of fantasy
A pretty smile and lovely face
Love this melody
Every night in a different place.

That no else will ever play
I know my destiny.

Oh oh, i believe in a flight of fantasy.

I know, you are the winner,
I just know you're breaking my heart, then I can't help it...

Burning in my mind, I were made to stay together,
I know, you are my killer,
And I know you're breakin' my heart...

I don't wanna fly
'Cause I'm ready to try
The passion deep inside is getting hot...

I don't wanna fly
Baby give me tonight
To lie the beated pieces of your heart...

But you have to let me go...

And caress me tonight
The rhythm of your lovin, take me high

When you take advice

'Cause I feel the rhythm inside
And you really need to know...
That I'm getting hot down inside
Come on baby let it flow...

Lay down your lies
'Cause it wouldn't be wise
I feel the superTo bangin' through the door...

When the night is getting closer
Nothing more I have to do
Time is short to reach my lover
But alone I'm feeling blue

Maybe it's not so easy
I will never stop loving you
Because you're deep inside my mind
I need you oh my little baby oh my little darling

Never gonna make a start
You never make me hurt
Baby don't leave me

Never surrender

Take my heart and keep (it) alive
Maybe one day you'll be mine
So baby never gonna make me a start
So don't refuse my love

Now I'm dreaming out of my mind
While I'm walking on the shore
Looking for a better daylight
Knocking back on heaven's door

I love your world
Where the winners might be sweet all around
Tell what you'll be afraid of this night.

If you wanna take a look around
Please don't hit a man who understands
As the story goes you are the one
Run away in other place
In the night you're looking for to meet
And checking the man to get in fit
Just the story goes you are the one
Run away in other place.

Yeti
Looking a horrid man
Yeti
Living in other land.

I want your soul
And I really like to seem to your heart
I feel with you
And I know that you are living apart.

If you wanna take a look around
Please don't hit a man who understands
As the story goes you are the one
Run away in other place
In the night you're looking for to meet
And checking the man to get in fit
Just the story goes you are the one
Run away in other place.

Yeti
Looking a horrid man
Yeti
Living in other land.

I just know your story
You are the queen of devils, you don't turn away
You believe in money, you don't like a honey
And get away

Lover of the vices, you don't feel the reason of the heart, I know
Girls it's gettin' too late, love can't have a long wait
You are wasting your time

* So don't care what the people are thinking
You can't hear what people are saying
But you're ready to rock all around me
Dancing 'till the break of the day
Until the break of the time

** Bad girls in the night, under bright moonlight
You are getting wild in the street
Girls bad girls in the night to my great surprise
You could say me now all your sins

In the night a stealer
By the day a dreamer, you are getting wrong
Waiting for desire
Very queen and liar, are you feeling so strong?

 *repeat
**repeat

Bad girls bad girls your are very bad girls
Naughty naughty bad girls!!!!

Romantic fever in the middle of the night,
You said, I know, you're counting my desire,
Or let you go, my prisoner of love...

Nothing to be afraid,
There is nothing to be said,
Everything will be right,
Let yourself tonight...

Come to my desire,
Are you ready for desire,

To the moon and back together oh...

No more lonely days, oh never

You'll feel fine
Staying close to me, forever

Me and you
When the stars are shining in the sky

Keep on rocking in the nite
Come inside with loving style
We've gone around together with a love alive
Take my soul and get me high
In the sky ( I ) don't see the light
You're gonna stay with me, I mean it, I'm your baby

We'll be the miracle and right in the town
They will be watching you and I ?

ROCKING THE CITY
Till the end of the beat
Until the dreams of love will survive
ROCKING THE CITY
With no doubt of defeating
Everyone who's out in the dark
ROCKING THE CITY

Keep on dancing all the time
Victim of your love tonite
Don't let me baby, only you can feel alive
As the world believe in you
I will show you what to do
You can go rocking like a thunder in the sky

Don't stop when I look in your eyes
Staying all around (there's) nothing I can do
Last dance, you can only play
Black jack, overtime is not forever

Too late! burning never again
Lost into your mind I can tell you why
My friend, someone else is right
Toc toc baby, only now you give me

Uh uh uh! I remember you don't love
Uh uh uh! ahh you crazy understand
Now I don't care about you my love
Ever and ever (I) only pleased my girl to be on

Get back!
You know I look for every wonder
You're not American girl
Get back!
Don't cry, you make me feel sad about you
You're not Americal girl

Got sad when you did not arrive
Walking up and down I was nervous too
Last chance, I was on my way
Back home baby, do you understand?

Too late! you can't call me again
Falling to your knees I could only cry
Your hands seem to me like dirty
Get back baby, just enough I had it

Another night looking for a passion
Another dream with my broken heart
A land of mystery, love and action
A magic potion, a lovely dart

In the game of love my heart is like a toy
You play the right direction
I'm just ready for a good vibration
I'm just keeping all of your passion

Crazy love 4 my heart the night is magic
Crazy love 4 my heart without control
Crazy love 4 my heart don't waste your logic
Move to the dance and set me free

Crazy love 4 my heart the game is danger
Crazy love 4 my heart you and me
Crazy love 4 my heart the love is stranger
A kind of magic, sugar babe set me free

A tale of love, full of risky actions
A crazy movie, without control
Let's go the story is rich in motion
Let's go we're moving with body and soul

Jump right now, you can get it if you want
Cause your life's gonna drive me crazy
Look around I'll be right there when you call
You can read my number on the wall

Another day for me just a simple day
And you're still faraway I fear
That if I let go I'll lose your love

Touch me up in the sky don't wonder why
No matter what sweet angel you can
Touch me, we're gonna fly and you know why
You need to love me tender baby
Touch me up in the sky don't wonder why
No matter what we will remember
Touch me, we're gonna fly and you know why
Now you cannot surrender cause you're mine!!!

When I'm down when I feel down on my knees
You came by in a nice mercedes
Changed my life now I'm begging baby please
Can't we be together all the time

Red skin m.n. it's the time to meet together!
When the light of moon, (it's) gonna shine upon the lake
(The) fight gets near and the warriors move their bodies
And the sound of drums, is gonna booming through the valley

And everybody look at their totem
Uah - uah - dance around the totem
Then every warrior is startin' dancing

Keep on dancin' the spirit lives forever
Cause the beat of drums goes straight now to your heart
Take the rhythm, the power fills your body
And your life will be, full of great emotions

Killing me softly baby
I need your poison in my veins
And tendeerly gimme love
You're like a virus in my brain

Together with we'll fly to heaven
Where there is no rain
And suddenly you will be a waken
You'll forget your pain

Love you for ever
Living together
We can share the heat
The only thing that we need tonight
Could be "to believe"

Stay, let the people say
You can renew my feelings
`Cause your love will set me free
Living in harmony, baby
Stay, let the people say
Oh baby can't you see my heart
Is thumpingto the beat
Living in harmony

You got to love me baby
I need your passion in my life
I wanna feel your love
Give you devotion every night

Baby belong to me
Every night I will love you tenderly
And I want (to) belong to you
Got to feel a new passion in my life

You make me feel my soul in paradise tonight
I don't wanna miss you
Tonight I'm gonna teach you
How we'll reach the sky

Oh baby
Harmony, my love is not a fantasy
I'm gonna take you to heaven
Baby take me high, every night

Oh baby
Harmony, my love is not a mystery
I'm gonna take you to heaven
Baby gimme a sign

You came into my life
I got you from the corner of my eyes
Remember the day you arrived
Never ending emotion in my mind

I'm the blood and you're the flesh
And together we can make it
Ready for another adventure faraway
So don't you say goodbye

I'm crying it out
This is my life (my life)
Nobody's gonna stop me now
And I'm gonna be

Black devil running in the desert
I wanna make it alive my baby
Black devil dancing for you
Until the dream is alive
Will (you) make it true

I don't wanna close my eyes
I just wanna see the morning
Ready for this world I will dry my tears away
And then I'll say goodbye

Can you hear my prayer
Prisoner to love enchained with rings of fire
You're my ruling power
Beating on my heart with drums of mad desire

But I still believe in miracles
You'll come back where you belong
It's a magic supernatural
Reaching out to touch your soul

You belong to me, belong to me
There'll be no more tears to stop this flame
You belong to me, belong to me
And whatever you do I'll be right back to you
You belong to me, belong to me
There'll be no more tears to stop this flame
You belong to me, belong to me
And wherever you go, know you're never alone
Let the glory of love shine on you

You're my sweet temptation
Growing on the poison of my heart's devotion
I'm in your possession
Never get enough of you, my wild obsession

Twisted, see I'm turned around your little finger
But your love is stronger and stronger
As you multiply your girls by numbers
Never say I've got you

You ring me up in the night
To say you've made up your mind
Then come tomorrow you're back to fancy free
If this is loving for you, it's only flirting for me
My heart is dancing a solo fandango

Sha-la-la don't you break my heart
So come alive and show me your love, I need you
Sha-la-la don't you break my heart
Together baby we can make it work forever
Sha-la-la don't you break my heart
You'll never know how deep is my love, I want you
Sha-la-la don't you break my heart
Together baby we can make it work forever

Babe, everybody needs to have somebody
But it takes a little believing
So I'd give you love and understanding
If you'd only let me

Walking, walking in the prison
Every one knew my condition
I weigh down under rage
Baby, only you can take me away
I don't let you lock me in the hell, no
Lady, lady... taste of freedom

And time and time again
A lever taking my hand
Oppressed, with no way out
I'm prisoner of love
You, warder, let's run away
Together... not forever

Chance,
GIMME A CHANCE tonight
Lose your fever
Don't cry, my baby
Take my devotion
Chance,
GIMME A CHANCE tonight
Now or never
Little, give me back all my freedom

Talking, talking competition
Talking well with high precision
And don't worry to hurt me
Soon or later we will do it, babe
I need one moment, give me up, you
Come on, come on, lead your fun now

Shake it up baby
Shake it up higher
Melt up together under my feet
Shake it up baby

Of dreams long ago these days are gone

I lose all control and have to give in

Now and never

I'm trying to survive in a jungle
A jungle of danger
There is always fighting here
Every one's a stranger

Run away
I know I should run away
And someday
Someday I know that I will
Run away

ANIMAL MAN-

You might bite my head off

There's a boy blacker than the night
Living near Cape Town
And he hates all of the injustice
That has kept him down

He looks up at the sky and he shouts
Why!?
He knows he can't take anymore
He picks up a gun
He tells everyone

Fight for your life
You gotta stand up and shout
You gotta fight for your dream
Fight for your right
For rights as a human being

He's about to shoot the President
From a window sill
But suddenly he throws down his gun
He knows he can not kill

He looks up at the sky and he shouts
Why?!
Then the police shoot him down and
Before he dies
He stumbles and cries

Burning like a star
I get a reaction, babe

I feel like the night
I go back in actionâ€¦
Babe!!!

Up and down, do you rock around?
I wanna feel the wheels on fire
Up and down, wonâ€™t you rock and do?
Iâ€™m gonna gonna reach for you

Run adventure in my car
Following the light of rainbow
Like a pilot in the stars
Shocking like a boom
Magic like the moon

Get into my car
And so you can drive me crazy

Live the city nights
Together with me nowâ€¦
Babe!!!

Loving you, girl, loving you, girl

What's going on
Oh, baby saturnine me
You want to know things I left behind
Tonight I should have stacked
You liquor's pile

But I say, baby
I'm fooling, wasting time
Aristocratic cousin, lady and king
I gave my love of very special queen
But why would you say
You don't know what you need
That's why, baby
I wanna tell you could be

So wrong, too long, this took
No matter, who you are
Now that I've discovered
Thousand reasons to believe in

Loving you, girl

Everytime it's so sweet
Loving you, girl

So that's why

I'm looking over the time
I'm looking above the light
You're my life
Baby you are so far away from me tonite
I'm gonna cry

I just wanna call your name
Till the end of my life
Let me be your man
I'm gonna take you higher

Girls and taxi driver flashing in the night
Now my ride is over and the time is right

Everytime I try to get you
(I) hear you say you're playing with my love
Spending time and looking at the same old days
There's nothing left to do.
Everytime I'm feeling better
You can say it's for I think of you
But our love today is more
Than being together
I got a loving for you!

And I search somebody on my way
A kind of dreams, (a) kind of play
Where I miss your body
Waiting there and talking to you
And in the dream I'm gettin'

Playing hard and fighting like the good old days
There's something you could do

Anytime you're feeling better
You can swear I'm feeling better too
But our love today is more
Than being together

'Cause you're playing with fire
Day by day you will lose control in this town
You've better come back to your mother babe!

HEY! YOU! WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE
Always looking back from downtown to your
neighbour
HEY! YOU! LIVING IN THE JUNGLE
Lions in your mind and snakes around your
body

You think you're touch and ready for the
actions
And every girl is waiting for your love deep
inside
Across the city in a yellow taxy
You cannot live into the block

Don't stop me darling, I'm fire and I'm doing alright
I bet you want me to kiss you, to give you my cure

Well you need to be the fastest 'cause pretenders are so many
Well you can be really in the fire only if I'll yell out

Hey you! You are my love-boy
Over and over I want to go down
Hey mate! You'll be my love-joy
Won't you come over? Or won't you get out?

Inside the club now you feel bowed and with no chances
But this is just how I want it, I like to be

Had it on my headphones playing all the time
Don't know what's going on
Had it on my iPod running in the park
It got me power on

I just can't explain i just can't obtain a pause
Some break down
What a superb song, what a nice refrain to sing along

It's like a din don, din don, into my brain
It's like a din don, din all over the place
Can't get out, so i sing it loud
Well i just don't mind

Play it in the club Dee Jay make it loud
To dance this night away
Play it in the subway when on my way home
I just can't get enough

Speed me to the limit on the other side
Movin' to the rhythm of the disco lights
You got to let it go
You got to dance it forever

Shake your body now and I feel alright
Flyin' in the space gettin' out of sight
I wanna make you stay
To love you better and better

Rock with me, step inside my dream
Want you see what I am?

Rocket man rocket man
Call me up I'll be there
Rocket man rocket rocket man
Rocket man rocket man
I'll take you up, yes I can
Rocket man rocket rocket man

Keep me lead me on the crazy night
Fool me on and on but I'm gonna fight
I'll spin you round 'n round
You catch me ever and ever

Fire in your heart and I feel you mine
Now you're gonna see what you never tried
I'll turn you on and more
It's gonna keep us together

Every night I want my spaceship take me higher
Flying to the moon is what makes me feel alright

My soul is crying for this sensation
New vibration, this is my mission
Being the king of universe
Is my final destination

Spaceman spaceman back to stars
Higher higher I'm a night flyer
Spaceman spaceman my starlight
I want to be a spaceman

Spaceman spaceman back to stars
Higher higher I'm a night flyer
Spaceman spaceman my starlight
I want to be a spaceman

Flying to the sky is my one only desire
Dreaming of the space is what sets my heart on fire

I don't need all the power and glory
I don't care 'bout the hall of fame
Listen, girl, it's the same old story
I can't live
Without your love

I need your precious kisses
That money just can't buy
Your touch is what I'm missin'
Can't say goodbye
Don't leave me cryin'

I can't live without you
And now you keep me hangin' on
Time and time forever
I can't live without you
'Cause baby as you feel so strong
Look my heart is breakin'

It's alright, if you're lookin' for freedom
Gettin' wild, baby, it's okay
I don't care what the people say 'cause
I can't live
Without your love

That begun years ago when I was
Just like a "bad boy boogie"
And when I was alone indeed
All around like a fool with my love
And with a "red red fire"
Deep down inside of my heart.

Everynight face to face in the smoke
I had the "Black Jack fever"
Not for money and for the chicks
In the dark I was there just to say
It has beeen a good good pleasure
Who want to play with me now?

Everybody was looking for the big star
And I was what they wanted
When everybody was waiting for the black card
(I) Was lucky for me.

BLACK JACK FEVER
Not for money and not for many diamonds
Bad bad fever
Not for money and not for many girlfriends
BLACK JACK FEVER
Not for money and not for many diamonds
Bad bad fever
Just for my name in the past and the green of the table.

In these days I re-think (of) the good times
It's just a mad mad passion
Sometimes (I) would be like before
Don't know why I can't stop for my life
This crazy black jack fever
I know it's burning in me.

Shake me up into your magic dreams
Check it up, check it up you better wake up
So break me into your nightmare
Baby your mind is hyper
Lay your hands on me babe

Screamin' all around
You feel the midnight call
The sound is booming inside
In the jungle of your mind
Gimme your night, gimme your nightmare

Take me down, take me down in your nightmare
For tonight, gimme the time of fire
Take me now, do it now - in your nightmare yeah!
Gimme your night, gimme your nightmare

Shake me up, your love is like a scream
I'll be there when you need me, now believe me
I see you like a shadow, be my scary lover
Lay your dream on me babe

Do you remember me
The words you used to say
I loved you always
Night and day

Got to get movin' on
Whenever I needed you left me home
Got to get movin' on
The more that I love you the more I cry

No more BAD LOVE BAD LOVE
To break my heart in two
Don't give me BAD LOVE BAD LOVE
Tearing my love apart
No more BAD LOVE BAD LOVE
To break my heart in two
Don't give me BAD LOVE BAD LOVE
Breaking this heart of mine

Do I remember when
The way you held my hands
I've always told you
Understand

Searching a sound on my piano keyboard
I'm just playing some melodies of love
With my hands I
Play all the keys with harmony
Looking for energy sound with a precious score

Is a lovely melody
Every day you can sing this song with me
Like a magic dream
The soundtrack for my sweetest film
A song for you, a sweet melody
The world of my love is full of satisfaction, take two minutes of ecstasy
And you start singing with me
And we can sing all the passion

A song for you, a soul rhapsody
The power of love is full of good reactions
Take two minutes of ecstasy
And you start singing wit hme
And we can sing all the passion... now!!

Ready to play, it's time to wake up and run now
Show you the way, don't worry we're gonna tell (you) how
Hey my baby, don't you want it loud

Just looking for you're smiling face
Your image so far away now

So far away from my dreams

When a bell will call me gonna be my dear mister right

And when I fall in love
Will stop the rain and the pain
And when I fall in love you will know
And when I fall in love
No one to blame no more shame
And when I fall in love it will grow

Every night every day
I look for love at first sight
Every time every way

You don't know the meaning
Have you never replayed the music that she gave you
I know what's the meaning

You are on the magazine
You are as a guest on TV
You are just the number one
You're my only reason to be

Super super SUPER SEX SYMBOL
Super super super exciting boy
Super super SUPER SEX SYMBOL
Super super super sexy boy

And when you decide to leave
People screaming "no no please stay"
And the chicks you leave behind
They can't find the right words to say

I still remember those lovely days
When I was
Just as a woman without her man
And every time I had any problem
I turned on the radio
Feeling

The power of the music inside
Feeling the fire that is driving me crazy
Sending a message in the name of
Passion to everybody
To every man
In the name of love

Radio, radio all the day I listen to my
Radio, ready to live another passion
Radio, radio all the day I'm dancing to the
Radio, ready to feel another tension

When I was driving the car so fast
I was looking like horse in the wind
Runnin' wild
And in my heart was flowin' the music
And beatin' the radio

Now I can feel my love & passion
Let's my heart, don't close my eyes
Changing my life, I live in danger
That's all right, 'cause I don't fear

Won't be afraid by my living lonely
Got to believe me, I'm gonna leave you
Wasted my time, then I got the fever
Giving you love but you gave it away

DON'T TELL ME LIES
(That) you wanna let me love you
(You) told me sometimes
You needed love inside you
Don't tell me why
You're feeling bad together
Leave me alone
Don't want you break my heart

Now that you set my heart on fire
Got to move, don't lose more time
Finally I can watch around (the) boys
Touch too much but I don't fear

I can't see the way out
And your love won't change my mind
I know what to do tonight
Don't you know I said goodbye

Station to station
I'm moving inside my heart
Stand by your station
Don't follow me now my guy
HERE COMES THE NIGHT
Like a spell takes away my heart from you babe
HERE COMES THE NIGHT
An emotion turning my desire got my soul

Can't you feel the fire
Which is burning in my heart
Don't you see I'm leaving you
'Cause I don't like you anytime

Please, listen to me
'Cause I have the key
Who says what love can be
Why you wanna try
'Cause I know the way
So I beg you to stay

Hold me, uh
Hold me like you'll never let me go
Another story's passin' by
You know I feel like I could die
Hold me, uh

But now I need you more and more

You, you know what do to
So don't say goodbye
I know the reaosn why

Please, you don't have to go

In perfect harmony

You wanna dance, a new romance
And late at night, you hold me tight
But I can see, you're fooling me
And I can't understand that my heart beats for you
And I just don't know what to do
Well I can see those lies into your eyes

*

Don't need someone like you
Slow honey honey, slow down honey honey
But I miss you
Slow honey honey, slow down honey honey

And suddenly you're here with me
A second chance, no one-night-stand
And I just can't control this situation
Cause you give me sensation
But I won't let this thing get out of hand

*Repeat

The night has come
you've not come back to me

Love and desire
Walking on the street

I never tell you
The words that will make you cry
Make you cry

I'm living for you
Forever will be
Baby come back to me, back to me

'Cause the night
Will make it right
And close to you

'Cause the night
That seems so dark
It's going to shine
For you and I

The night has gone
You didn't come to me

A rising sun
It's shining down the street

Summer fade away
As the memories of our days together
Leaves the winter in my heart

Tell me what to do when I need you
You're far away and I'm so blue
I'm crying out your name alone in the rain

If you stay with me forever
If you stay with me we'll never
Waste a single time regretting
Everything for something better

If you stay with me forever
We could fly until the Heaven
Nothing in this world
Will ever more be stronger than our love

Tears upon my face
I'm not longer sad
And I will flight to be
Again in your embrace

I have to leave my heart
And go away
To a land across the farest sea
But my thoughts
Will always be by you
If I should never come
Don't cry in vain

Aloha-oe - Aloha-oe
Be back again some day
And then I'll stay
Your warm embrace
Will leave a trace
Until we meet again

Through seven seas and hills
I'm outward bound
But one thing I know
My heart is found
When the wind blows
Tahiti girl, beware
It could be that I'm homeward bound

Aloha-oe - Aloha-oe,...

Baby do you know
When you look into my eyes

Without you my heart goes bye

Many time waiting for you

What's the use of freedom if I can't have you I wonder why
Locked inside the prison of your heart there's nothing else I'd like

Tell me what's the meaning
I don't understand you're looking for
You got to take my love, my passion
When you touch me feeling the
pressure

Don't you keep me hangin' on
Don't tell me if there is something wrong now
Don't you keep me hangin' on
Don't tell me "I want to think about it"

It's a rainy day for me
It's a rainy day you see
Maybe I should have saved that time
Funny how funny how
Love becomes a cold rain

It's a rainy day for me
It's a rainy day you see
Maybe I should turn back the time
Funny how funny how
Love becomes a cold rain

Baby 
Before you leave
Before you say good bye

Save my prayer, only 4 your love
My desire, all my fire
All my passion full of action

Only 4 your love...

Nobody knows my cry
Nobody knows that I try to send a
message 4 you
Walking on the sand in a rainy day
Don't forget my shout of love
My sweet emotion

Tonight you're feeling me so fine
I like to work around and
Oh, oh, oh, wanna be like an angel

And now to make me down
You're body makes me frown
If I will be so close to you
You're gonna take my waste so
Oh, oh, oh, wanna be like an angel

Walk this club, heart and soul
You gotta feel, took a night and that's the...
Take my hand and carry me
Well love's gonna be, be forever

Wanna love, surrendor!
I'm breaking through my heart
Because you're like an angel
And you're the way you are
And they'll send you, my angel
You're shining through the sky, we'll get it
Call me baby, I love so far
Nothing can be so rude
Can shake me apart

I wanna be with you
Because you need me too
You're love can be so hard tonight
I wanna take it baby
Oh, oh, oh, wanna be like an angel

I came to get me down
I won't be out of bound
Without you're love, I lose my way
Oh please don't hide me baby
Oh, oh, oh, wanna be like an angel

Say your prayers little one
Don’t forget, my son
To include everyone

Tuck you in, warm within
Keep you free from sin
Till the sandman he comes

Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
Off to never never land

Something’s wrong, shut the light
Heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren’t of snow white

Dreams of war, dreams of liars
Dreams of dragon’s fire
And of things that will bite

Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
Off to never never land

Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray the lord my soul to keep
If I die before I wake
Pray the lord my soul to take

Hush little baby, don’t say a word
And never mind that noise you heard
It’s just the beast under your bed,
In your closet, in your head

Exit light
Enter night
Grain of sand

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We’re off to never never land

Remembering lonely nights
Until the lucky strike
Now you're the rainbow shining in my bright life

Remembering all my days
Before you came that night
I whisper only words of love for you now

Open your eyes, wake me up each morning
Open your mind, don't give up and show me
What is your love in the fire of my heart
You look too sensual

Blue sky, stargate to find your love
Tell me it lasts forever
Give all the potion to my heart
Stargate to heaven

There was a lonely heart
You brought a lucky star
In every single beat of my existence

I'm living all the nights
I'm living all my days
Thinking of you in my arms, oh little babe

Hey I just wanna scream out again... once again
I just wanna hit my guitar with my hands
Don't be surprised if I'm calling you name
Baby I will follow the stars on my head

Hey! I wanna call U again and again
With your voice U carry me on the sand
Where my pain has gone so close to the waves
I don't wanna dress me for maskin' myself

Into my mind
Into my brain
Heart's on fire
Far away I have a dream to spend with U...
Listen to me
Right from my heart...

Day by day I wonder if every
Night you will be mine
Step by step I go so crazy
I don't, king of your delight, my baby

I want to leave, the night is magical
I need your kiss, my angel
Tonight my life is like a miracle
Over and over again

Yes I love to be my darling baby
Kiss me or make me go

Night and day you listen to my heart
Never make me cry

In two.

When I look in your eyes, I feel this is not a pleasure
Make a dive in the light, wish me good luck for tonight
I can't stop loving you

My life is rollin' down one day
Don't make me cry 'cause I'm thinking "why"
I've always loved you in my life
Cause I belong to you

Don't you remember when we played the fantasy
I belong to you
Open your gate, this is just like a harmony
C'mon and set me free
Don't you forget all my for eternity

In Japan my lonely night
It was my destination
Break my heart now, stay together!
Love me now forever

Feel the sound of my heart, it's an illusion forever
Leave me now for the night, I can't stand your hand in mine
I can't stop loving you

Now as ever, feel I'm gettin' round
I wanna come down
Just like never, never in my life
I've known what I like

All the small feats
All the big deeps
All I want more
I know I'll strive for

And I'll forever fly
I know I can try
Catching dreams on high
And I'll forever fly
I'll be strong enough
To get on with a smile
Forever fly

Get together, baby, be yourself
And nobody else
Learnin' harder, better all the time
What I wanna find

I don't wanna get up in the night
Never ending emotion
Let me fly without my hazel eyes, tonight I will fly high

Let me be the one for you and for me
Flowers blooming in eternity
Let me wake up in the morning to see, it's for me
The shining light, it is so bright

Awake, I can feel the power in my veins
Awake, there's no need to walk away from me
Dreaming all night because the sky is dark
Energy is in my body
And now close your eyes, lay down for me, it's time to go sleep now

Got my mind hot on the move
Take my chance and go your way
Lookin' for you
Lookin' for you

My heart dancin' to the groove
Hurry baby don't be late

Then I suddenly get shy
When I'm with you
When I'm with you

I see the time of darkness
In the land of nowhere
This is good for a prisoner

Why don't you fight me now
Let me now on fire

Put your feet down on the ground
Get off the silence around yourself
And you just will see you're free

Love is the way to go the place I know
Where I never give up my love

And i'm gonna be yours

Everybody is aware
We gotta build together now
A better livin' where everything is all right

Love, it seems like only yesterday
You were just a child at play
Now you're all grown up inside of me
Oh, how fast those moments flee

Once we watched a lazy world go by
Now the days seem to fly
Life is brief, but when it's gone
Love goes on and on

When you are dancing I realize
That you're the guy that I'll love forever
You keep on dancing I see I'm alive
The light is shining thru

It's a satellite that goes all around the world
Open your heart and just be ready to know
That all your music is love

Another night into the music
Nothing but a happy sensation
Lights around me dancing in the disco

Always I've been searching always
And I need you tonight and I want you tonite
Cos you got to be my side :
I'm gonna give you

One night to remember dancing with you
One night in September something is new

And I believe in you

One night to remember into the lights
In love with a stranger feeling all right
There's love in my eyes to dance away
And I believe in you

Now the floor I dance on
Is gonna become a sky forever
And I feel the touch a body, the music on me
Dancing in the disco

Life is a game we cannot hide
And it's a race against the time
To believe a world together

And you gotta dream inside the blue
You gotta find your number two
Let the feeling be your guide tonight

Never say never
For love is forever
Nothing can hold you so tight

Spread your wings and fly
In the morning of every night
In the day with the sun in your eyes
Where tomorrow never dies
Spread your wings and fly
Take a ride over millions of shores
And you'll dance and you'll sing evermore
So just take it for tonight
Spread your wings and fly

I play the game, I cannot hide
And the race against the time
'S gonna take the world together

Looking for love in the sky
At every corner
Growin' weaker when you try again
But no longer

Trust you baby, not every lover
Every man that goes "Together..."
Don't you look at me this way
Cos I'm gonna say

I'll never fall in love again
I did promise you one day
Till you make it paradise
Till my time is on your way
I'll never fall in love again
I'm just born with you today
Just remember I'm a star tonight
I'm shining in the sky

Nothing's hiding in the sky
Love is right here
Growin' stronger when you find again
That I've got to

If I never knew you, if I never felt this love
I would have no inkling of how precious life can be
And if I never held you, I would never have a clue
How at last I find in you, the missing part of me.

In this world so full of fear, full of rage and lies
I can see the truth so clear, in your eyes, so dry your eyes
And I’m so grateful to you, I’d have lived my whole life through
Lost forever, if I never knew you.

If I never knew you, I’d be safe but half as real
Never knowing I could feel a love so strong and true
I’m so grateful to you, I’d have lived my whole life through
Lost forever, if I never knew you.


I thought our love would be so beautiful
Somehow we make the whole world right
I never knew that fear and hate could be so strong
All they leave are worthless whispers in the night
But still my heart is saying we were right.

If I never knew you
There is no moment I regret
If I never knew this love
Since the moment that we met
I’d have no inkling of how precious life can be
If our time’s auspicious as that
Is here at last.

I thought our love would be so beautiful
So beautiful...
Somehow we make the world right
I thought our love would be so beautiful
We turn the darkness into light
And still my heart is saying we were right.

We were right
And if I never knew you
And if I never knew you
I’d have lived my whole life through
Empty as the sky
Never knowing why
Lost forever
If I never knew you

If I never knew you 
If I never felt this love 
I would have no inkling of 
How precious life can be 

And if I never held you 
I would never have a clue 
How at last I find in you 
The missing part of me 

In this world so full of fear 
Full of rage and lies 
I can see the truth so clear 
In your eyes 
So dry your eyes 

And I’m so grateful to you 
I’d have lived my whole life through 
Lost forever 
If I never knew you

If I never knew you
I’d be safe by half as real
Never knowing how I could feel
A love so strong and true

I’m so grateful to you
I’d have lived my whole life through
Lost forever 
If I never knew you 

I thought our love would be so beautiful 
Somehow we make the whole world bright 
I never knew that fear and hate could be so strong 
All they’d leave us were these whispers in the night 
But still my heart is saying we were right (woah oh oh oh...)

Oh, if I never knew you 
If I never knew your love 
I would have no inkling of 
How precious life can be

(There’s no moment I regret 
Since the moment that we met 
If our time has gone too fast 
I’ve lived at last) 

I thought our love would be so beautiful 
Somehow we make the whole world bright 
I thought our love would be so beautiful 
We’d turn the darkness into light 
And still my heart is saying we were right 
We were right 

And if I never knew you 
(If I never knew you) 
I’d have lived my whole life through 
Empty as the sky 
Never knowing why 
Lost forever 
If I never knew you

Wants me to think of you

With magic of the sounds
I wanna make you mine
Every step and turn
Let's get down to the free world

When I finish a day
I'm like an empty closet
Nothin' to choose
Going straight back home
Turn on the radio
Laying down on the bed

But sometimes I miss the beat
Deep down inside my heart
Telling me to get up
Then call up my friends
Here we go again tonight
'Get together'

I wanna take you high
High up in the sky
Until you loose control
I wanna make you dance
Make your soul release
This room's for two of us

Met a girl of my dream
She's got an angel smile
Looking my eyes
Coming through the door
She took my breath away
Knocking me down

Should I go and say hello?
Maybe it's the only chance
Asking her out to be
Staying by my side
She will be the queen of the night
Forevermore

Steve walks warily down the street
with the brim pulled way down low
Ain't no sound by the sound of his feet
machine guns ready to go
Are you, Are you ready for this
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat

Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust

How do you think I'm going to get along
without you, when you're gone
You took me for everything that I had
and kicked me out on my own
Are you happy, are you satisfied
How long can you stand the heat
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat

Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
There are plenty of ways you can hurt a man
And bring him to the ground
You can beat him
You can cheat him
you can treat him bad and leave him
When he's down
But I'm ready, yes I'm ready for you
I'm standing on my own two feet
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
reapeating the sound of the beat

In my heart and soul
Will this be true again
I'll be there waiting

You're falling into my heart
I can't believe you're coming back
Until the morning light
You're rolling back to the star
I don't know where to go
Wherever I get you
You're falling into my heart
I can't believe you're coming back
Until the morning light
You're rolling back to the star
I don't know where to go
Lost in the night with you

Close your eyes and let me touch your soul
When I feel your lips
(I'm) falling to the floor

I'm gonna leave you but you don't give up
Carry on carry on you're trying to kiss me
I've got nothing to give you but you want my love
Carry on carry on you wish to touch me

Forget the past cause a girl can make a silly miss
Got to push and got to move you
I'm in a trouble I turn you down but you come back
Got to try to get rid of you

Boomerang, a boomerang boy you seem to me
Boomerang, a boomerang I throw it away
Boomerang, a boomerang you're sticked up to me
I pitched you far but you are coming back and stay

Boomerang, a boomerang boy you seem to me
Boomerang, a boomerang you're driving me mad
Boomerang, a boomerang too sticky to me
Never give up to run away and I'm so sad

Close the door but you ring the bell
Carry on carry on to look for my love
I'm shutted at home and my life is a hell
Carry on carry on don't want to give up

Going to disco party
Don't believe runaway
Looking for you my baby night and day

For me and you
I'll be forever crazy
You gonna get always ready
We over the world to together on 'n on again

Everybody's warming
All around feel the sound
Get your body and move ya
Me and you love you too

Gonna get out your feeling
Now it is movin' on
I will be happy to turn it on

Move it baby you see I'm ready to start
Ready to dance
Shuffle baby I know you're crazy for me
there's no chance

Baby don't you know your dance is so good
I can't stop this rhythm is my light
Baby don't you know I'm talking to you
I want to all this night

C'mon move your feet so move it baby
I wanna hold you now
C'mon move your body shake it baby
I really have no doubt
You got to move your feet so move it baby
I wanna hold you now
C'mon move your body shakin' baby
I really have no doubt

Move it baby and shake your hands so the dance
Keep going on
Shuffle baby nad move your feet on the floor
Don't be alone

Nothing ever brings me down down baby
Freaking out to have some fun
Shake my body to the sound like crazy
Dance myself out of my mind

But tonight I got a new sensation
Tell me why
I feel a strange emotion
Tell me why

Baby won't you tell me why
My dreams came true
Cried to the moon
To have you

Baby won't you tell me why
Temptation wild
A magic night
For us

Baby won't you tell me why

Turn me on and let me down down baby
Till I'm longing for your soul
All the things you do to keep me waiting
Make me go out of control

This is not a story this is the truth
I found an angel in the shallow waters of the town
Believe me
He told me "I'm sorry where is the moon?"
I understood that he was lost I've seen that stranger gown

They say there's no sex in angels
But he was so beauty
Oh he was so beautiful
I felt my mind was in danger
In love with an angel and so pure

You're an angel
But I can burn down in hell for you eternally
You're an angel
But with a heart full of love I face my destiny
You're an angel
Sent in this world to save us from all this misery
You're an angel 
I don't have courage to ask an angel to love me
You're an angel

This is not a story this is the truth
He took my hand told me "Baby you don't wear a frown"
Believe me
Came to me and kiss me "That's what I do,
Please baby love me like a woman, love me until dawn"

Stay tonight!
Without love and little lies
Tell me, (do) you feel fine?
Uooh! love is the best game
Lonely night
I remember (I) felt sometime
Backin' the future
Uooh! longin' the past times

Time after time
Without a friend and sigh forever alone
Say you'll be mine
Will you release me now
Don't keep me hangin' on

Big time
Ever and ever, love and
Real time
Dance without you
Best time
Only together, like a longtime ago
When I got back to your love

Will you stay?
Without love and sweet surprises
Tell me (do) you feel fine?
Uooh! love the best game

Stay tonight!
I just wonder why and why
Backin' the future
Uooh! longin' the past times

Little baby playing with emotions
Playing games with her life
And you can touch me
Honey such a vision
You see your body go by

Don't wanna let you go
In the nite on the phone
As I wake up alone in the bed
I need your lullaby just for me
So I will tell you

Get me started
DANCING IN THE FIRE
It's the way that it's got to be
Let me love you
Burnin' with desire
So we gonna be free

You're my baby, you're my only lover
Here's the love that we share
Shake my body, till the heat is over
Throw my heart in the air

Do you tell me that your body?
Is hot for love, you need somebody
Oh no you just pretend it
With someone else I think you got it

Hey girl
What can I do for your love
I'm wasting my time gettin' crazy for you
Hey girl
Calling my heart screaming too
I don't believe you can do

Don't go breaking my heart
Lady
To someone else
You just gave your love
Don't go breaking my heart
Baby
Don't try again
You can't push my mind

I know you feel that tomorrow
I'll cry for love
(And) scream for sorrow
No no you'(re) wrong! You can't be
The girl I love I know you'(d) kill me

Don't know how's your reaction
But I feel like I'd see your face
Yes I need your protection
'Cause it seems that I've lost my
place

Now touch me, kiss me, light my
dreams
Oh heaven! You heal my body, my
soul
So take me, I will die for you,
together

(We) Gotta spend all the nights,
Night long
Like the American people
Just remember all lights, bright
lights,
L.A. Time you can recall
Don't forget all affection
That I still keep inside my soul
Can't escape your deception
When I see ya I lose control

I can't see the reason why
I can't stand it for a day
Just one pretty little way
Baby, to hold me.

Bad, bad fire
Yes I am on fire
Red, red fire
Burning deep inside

But you can stand it for my love, babe
That's why you can stand it, love
And once you take it as a lover
Everytime will be just like the first time

Red, red fire
(I) Tell you what's my fire
That can take you higher red,red fire
bad, bad fire
(I) Tell you that's my power
Come on join the fire bad, bad fire

Will you show me you can feel
All the power of the flames
Father sun is jsut the same
Come here beside me

Take it higher on a Saturday night
Each town looks the same
Small world (and) local girls
Play the pick-up game
Got no reason to get all up tight
I take life as it comes
Make tracks and don't look back
I'm havin' too much fun

And it's one shot it's a bust
One shot lookin' tough
One shot can't get enough
One shot it's a scam
One shot take what you can

Oh oh oh girls are dancin'
Oh oh oh girls are dancin'

And in the morning when the sun
comes up
The light shines in my eyes
No debts and no regrets
I'm livin' with the lie
My girl moves and sways
It's a dream that always fades
Before long she goes back home
(cause) There's nothing else to say

Don't you tell me what your love can do
It can happen, oh just anywhere
Your nasty touch doesn't mean a thing tonight
Those eyes when you look at me
You think I'm gonna take it from you?

I'm not into old fashioned movie scenes
Love's a gamble when you're in this town
This big city is a lonely place
When you're all alone, the city light will glow
It can lead you to get crazy

Can't live without you babe
Can't live without you babe
Can't live without you babe
Don't wanna let you go
Can't live without you babe
Can't live without you babe
Can't live without you babe
Don't wanna let you go

I'm only playing games with you
It doesn't worry me, you're doing it too
But maybe someday I will fall in love with you
You're just a sweet little lover boy
So don't you tell me that I'm only yours
Starting to sound like a cheap ole gigolo

When you wake in the middle of town
This big city is a lonely place
It's when you feel his breath
Together in your bed
You might be able to reach your best dreams

Another time alone tonight
I'll see you tomorrow
My heart in stand-by,
(like the) underground
It's to late

By-blowin' time
To make me feel so right
Say you'll be mine
And when I look into your eyes

I feel rock and roll
It's a real fight to heaven
Come on do it love
But it's deadly hard
with broken wings

Another kiss, another smile
Are ready to borrow
My independence's game away
With my face

Ending without a place
With nothing more to say
Closed in my silent room
Waiting for better days

Midnight is coming
There is no more to do
Now it's too late for me, my girl
To be with you

Lonely time, this time
Dreaming that you'd be mine
To give myself to you
Is what I have to do

Please don't leave me this way
Why you're so far away
When I wish you were here tonight
So deep inside my mind, lover
I see you everywhere
Coming out of nowhere
Night and day waiting for a cold
Only the sensual lovers

So I will never change
My heart will beat in time
And I will wait for you
Until the morning light

In this glowing time
The wind is blowing all around
And like your love
The leaves are falling on the ground

Everytime I cry
Look into your eyes
Nothing ever makes me crying
When I'm feeling blue
Time a gaze on you
Got to know where you are

'Coz you know the place where I will find the force
Soul gasoline, that's all you need
And you know tonite what will make me fly it will take me high
Can't you hear me!?

Soul gasoline that's all I need
Never end this fight where I got to be. Don't you know
Soul gasoline power to go
Down inside my heart a place where I long for more

Soul gasoline inside and out
Never end this night I'm living about. Can't you see
Soul gasoline really the best
And I'm leavin' the rest away!

Every word you say
As I turn away
Is a cure - all to my sadness
Stay inside my heart
Little girl of mine
I'll know where you are

Always near to help me thru tonite
I need to take you now
Voices tell me you'll be mine

I play but I look into your eyes
I like connection, easy reaction

My fame is to be forever wild
Moving affections, bad reputation

Promised man is the real terrible fate
Voices arise that one day I might get over

Looking inside, now understanding
Only time will save my music
Feeling at times, I know the reasons
Paradise can't last as a life time

My game is just playing in the night
I need protection, major election

My shame is to be forever wild
Changing affections, bad reputation

Time goes bye and people fade to grey
Time goes bye and never be the same
But you are not alone
I will never go
Away from you away from you

Love or lie what are you looking for?
Love or lie a passion for your soul?
But you are not alone
I will never go
Away from you away from you

Aih aih aih aih
It's so hard to love, it's so hard to be oh baby
Aih aih aih aih
Try again to love you will feel the hit

Hey little Don
What is right and what is wrong?
One for you one for me
Tell me what you wanna be

Singin' hey hey hey
This is what you wanna say
If you look into the sky
There will be your paradise, hey!

Change your mind you have to take the way
Change your mind cause you are not to blame
You are not alone
I will never go
Away from you away from you

Don't deny the feeling of your soul
Don't deny it's glowing on your own
You are not alone
I will never go
Away from you away from you

Stormy clouds upon the sky
Tell me why we're not together
You are always on my mind
You can't break my heart forever

Day after day
Without you, only rain
I feel down again, down again

This lovely game
It will take me away
I can't stand anymore

Getaway
Getaway
Seems so hard to go on
If we're not together
Getaway
Getaway
All I need is your love
Close to you forever

Stormy clouds upon the sky
Tell me why you love another
You are always on my mind
We were made to love each other

Hootchie Cootchie! Hootchie Cootchie!
I can't believe it like a cheat fever it's
growing inside our mind

Hootchie Cootchie! Hootchie Cootchie!
I can't believe it baby like a jo-jo rock and
roll all the time

Get up and go go, baby just do it
and everybody come and dance on the floor
Get up and go go, do it and do it
having had alot of fun, having more and more

Come on everybody come on, it's not a miracle
Come on everybody come on!
We all together
Keep on everybody keep on, a technological
Keep on everybody keep on, a technological world

Hootchie Cootchie! Hootchie Cootchie!
I can't believe it like a hot reaction I can't
stop movin on

Hootchie Cootchie! Hootchie Cootchie!
I can't believe it listen to the disco and the
rhythm goes on

'Round and 'round
Walking in the city
Where the night is hot and young

Up and down
Dancing on the ceiling
All is movin', all is sound

Hey DJ
Let the music play
I don't wanna stop to dance now
'Cause tonight everything's all right
And I don't wanna lose the chance
To be with you now

Hypnotized
By your blue eyes
I can't deny
Uoh-uoh-ouh oh
I'm going crazy
Hypnotized
Throughout the night
No dark, no light
Uoh-uoh-ouh oh
I'm gonna get you, now

In the night
Walking in the city
And the time it seems to fly

You're in danger
See the hunger
Kill the love again

Men and ladies
Old and babies
Sunny or rainy days

Ah ah ah ah ah
You feel the power of the bad here oh oh
Ah ah ah ah ah
I got to know what we can do!

Fell our love to love all together
Everybody arm in arm
To paint the night and shine on forever
Live in this paradise
Wake up today, I know your desires
And tonight the dreams come true
This energy destory all the liars
We'll be out of the blue

You're in danger
Here the stranger
Lonely with the pain

No more happy
No more lucky
No more funny days

Rust is long deep inside of me

You burn like a fire in the night
Breakin' out
Scream and shout
And light up desire

On the road of goin' wild

But I can see your eyes, they glow

They'll never catch you

Wheelin' round and around
Reachin' for the sun
Spirit go wild (tonight)
Glowin' out your light in the dark night

Sharp and feelin' fine
Reachin' for the stars

Got a puzzled mind
Got a dream to hang on to
Keep the flame inside
Don't you break in two

Snatchin' and scratchin'
With flames of fire
That's the way you got your desire
Steamin' and screamin'
And shoutin' louder

Showtime is hi time
For you to shine on
I'm just the stair that you walk upon
You go pretendin'
I'm right your lover
You're mistaken, girl

I got to feel everybody's kinda livin' crazy
They walk the stree of desire movin' much too slow

I got a burnin' fire
Never care if you,re sorry for me
You better hold on tighter
I'm reachin' higher higher you'll never stop me

Speed of light
I'm ragin' all around

Speed of light
I'm always on the sun

Speed of light

This time is gonna be cool, and every day is my day
Can you feel no panic at all, take off my horror hood

Huntin' for emotions
Solitary mission
Never mind your style
Standin' on a corner
Waitin' for disorder
And inside a fight

Go, a bomb out of the blue
You know that could be you
Just gettin' wild
Screamin' thru the night

The snake around
Crazy feelin' get me more power
The snake around
Reelin' your brain, all over your body
The snake around
Are you gonna catch the same fever
The snake around
Comin' to getcha, comin' around you

Gotta feel the flamin'
Like a freaky demon
It's a do or die
Ringin' all around me
Twistin' and a-rollin'
Cravin' mad desire

We are the girl, we are the door, we are the lightning in the sky
We got the heart, we got to start, and we love...
And we love it baby

I've got the power in my knees
And all united we go dancing away
Away, we are the...

Women on time... feeling the rhythm
Down on the floor, dancing all together
Women on time... heating the fever
Never alone... and never talk to stranger

We scream it proud, we scream it loud, we scream and shout at
Every man
We work all night, we work all tight, and we love and we love it baby

I'm your imagination
I know we can fly, in another place
Now let's go to the city
Let me take you away
This is not an illusion

Keeping the rhythm of your heart
I want you

Just in time to tell you my name tonight
You're making me crazy

Day & night
I need you
Never let me go away babe
Day & night

You know I'm a believer
Show me now your dreams and they will come true
I know you won't decieve me
Day & night you will stay
Forever & ever

Just another among all the lovers' songs
We're together baby let me tell you
Something not new

Love me
Over again
Make me feel I'm really someone
That you're needing
And you wanna hold me in your arms

Gonna (I will) take you
Far away till we can stay together
To get everyday my love
To make and grow a better life
Gonna take you
Far Away now we can be together
I just look at your eyes and see
That you will be the one to say
Gonna take you far away

So it's easy what else have you got to say?
When you love somebody
Anything will show you the way

I wanna share this beautiful moment
Hello babe! tell me you're free tonight
Take a chance, boy, we can be lovers again
Just try me

Come over me
And forget your misery
A fascinating night
Shooting the breeze with you
'Cause I want you!!!

Fly to me to the moon & back
Like a magical dream... just you & me
Fly with me faraway from here
I feel over the moon... you'll see my fire

Believe in me, oh baby I'll get you
'Cause I really wanna belong to you
Be an angel and follow my credible love
I need you!!!

Come out moon
Come out wishing star
Come out
Come out
Wherever you are

I’m alone here in the dark
All alone and wide awake
Come and find me
I’m empty and I’m cold 
And my heart is about to break 
Come and find me

A need you to come here and find me
Cause without you I’m totally lost
I've hung a wish on every star
It hasn’t done much good so far 
I can only dream of you
Wherever you are

I’ll hear you laugh
I’ll see you smile
I’ll be with you just for a while
But when the morning comes
And the sun begins to rise
I’ll lose you

Because it’s just a dream
When I open up my eyes
I’ll lose you

I use to believe in forever
But forever is to good to be true
I've hung a wish on every star
It hasn’t done much good so far 

I don’t know what else to do
Except to try to dream of you
And wonder if you are dreaming to
Wherever you are

Wherever you are

I'm sitting in my room
I don't know what to do
Except to move and feel
Completely mad

There's only a way for me
To wake up from this dream
But I am sure that you
Will disagree

Passing all the time
Trying to be what you will like
It is proving me
It's just stressing me
I need to run away
Need to find myself the way
To be just what I am
You gotta listen to...

The game we play it is dangerous
To be or notta be
On the river of emptiness
I'm waiting just for your moves
The game we play is my loneliness
To be or notta be
So far away is my happiness
So far to my world... honey

To be or notta be
She's gonna say to me
"I wanna move the groove inside your soul"

I wanna find the beat
And now give it to me
That's what you need
Ah ah... and watch me now

Drive me crazy I'm gonna be your lady
this the way boy I should feel
you can hold me, you can touch me
by your caresses I thrill

And if you need a blue cold drink
Or if you do not want to think
call me babe, dial my number, come to me

Tell me baby, if I'll be your lady
it's the way I long to be
I don't need no gold and diamond
only love and fantasy

And if you look into my eyes
and if you capture all my time
call me baby, dial my number, come to me

My lovely dancer, oh oh oh, set me free
My hot romancer, everytime you'll be kind
to me

Waiting for your call

No time to hesitate
Those who run seem to have all the fun

Time goes by so slowly
I don't know what to do

Tick tick tock it's a quarter to two
And I'm done
I'm hangin' up on you

I can't keep on waiting for you
I know that you're still hesitating
Don't cry for me

You'll wake up one day

There is nothing to say
Just wanna run with you away
Ain't no fear
We can be happy together

You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life
See that girl, watch that scene, digging the Dancing Queen

Friday night and the lights are low
Looking out for the place to go
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing
You come in to look for a king
Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance...

You are the Dancing Queen, young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing Queen, feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah
You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life
See that girl, watch that scene, digging the Dancing Queen

You're a teaser, you turn them on
Leave them burning and then you're gone
Looking out for another, anyone will do
You're in the mood for a dance

You are the Dancing Queen, young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing Queen, feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah
You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life
See that girl, watch that scene, digging the Dancing Queen
Digging the Dancing Queen

I saw you walking down the way
Looking like a city flower 
Waving me with a sunny smile
Making all my day complete

I've got you moving by my side
And it gotta make feel better
Steppin' into my lonely day
Givin' all your love to me

Hiding all that you couldn't see
Oh baby take a chance on me

Something crazy within my head
Babe you can be my lover
Something wild i can make instead
Gotta be the rule to me

Drivin' me to insanity
(I) Gotta satisfy my pleasure
But i turn to reality
And you run away from me

Feeling sorry for what have been
The world is not enough to me

Listen to my mind
You're running back in time
When I start to feel the navies
You be mine

Now I see the chills
So deep inside this game
Honey now you know
This love is not the shame

I wanna take you to my life
It's really hard, but you be looking so alone
If you just couldn't be so fly
Come on and feel the passion
That's growin' in you and me
You have to see it

Let your body love
This feeling more and more
Why don't you try to kiss me more

Let your body love
We'll make it all night long
Come on there's nothing really wrong
I fend my love for your heart, woah - woah

Waiting all alone
The music in my dreams
Thinking oppurtunities
See me on my knees

Honey you're my treasure
You're my little divine
Living without you
It wouldn't be so fine

Without a love I can't stay now and never
I need emotion
Look at my heart that is beating for you, for you
Look at me too!

Without your smile
I can't wish nothing else for my life

Now that the summer is gone
And the winter is coming
I've never felt alone more
Baby baby don't leave me oh oh oh

The game is over you missed me
And missed me forever
The game of love stopped to play
Deep inside of your heart

Killer of love now I know
You will play with another
A day you've stolen my heart
In the heat of the night

My blue eyes deep in my mind
You have taken all of my life
My blue eyes you made me die
Far away from me all the time

Love is a game what a game
I can feel all the power
Power of love and tonight
I will stay without without you

Get your freedom
Don't be liar 
Heaven help me take me higher 
Through the rhythm
On the fire
I confuted into your eyes

Lose control

Got a riddle in my mind
Got a reason to keep on now
Happiness's so hard to find
Girl you stay with me tonight

Since you and I met on seaside
There's something burning in my mind
I can't explain, I tried in vain,
I couldn't help myself

What I know... is I'm alive, what it shows... is I feel fine,
there is nothing else, no one else's stuff I'm dreaming of
I'm falling...

... down in the flames and the fire, the fire,
It ain't like a bad land, it ain't like a quick sand
I fall in the flames of your fire, my fire,
I don't feel the wild one,
I don't feel alone

The way you smile, the way you rise,
It strikes me out,
I can't walk out
I've never felt the way I feel,
But I won't ever leave

Let me tell you my mind
Put in your heart and keep it keep it all
Let me tell my desire
That you'll never forget
Tellin' you no regrets

You tell me you're cold on the inside
How can the outside world
He must have so really hurt you
To make you say the things you do

You need a lover that can be a friend
Will makes you happy again and again
Ever you want me you know I will be
One that will make you so free

Must have known that he could
Will you never leave him, and leave at all
Now you got to believe but, but believing in me
In my love that it's true

I'm in love with you
My time with you is right
Love is not to blame
So you can get me

Keep me satisfied
You are my only true
You have all my life
Why don't believe it

Like a sinful game you take me higher
Like a flame my heart can set on fire

Every more you make
I will be watchin' you
Everything you say
I'll be your lover

Take me by your side
I will just call you love
Looking for your style
I'm getting stronger

Like a winding track your love is power
Like a flame my heart can set on fire

Oh my boy I hope this feeling never ends tonight
Baby I will get to know you in a special way
If your love for inspiration I will be so fine
I can feel my free I can feel my free

Loving you so long
I'll keep you satisfied
You can't get away
This is my order

I'm looking for a thrill, I'm looking for a real
Bad, bad, bad joy
I'm gonna have a meal and I just need a drill
Just a bed toy

I want him today, I'll get him to pray,
I'd like him to be my lover.
He's mine anytime, he's mine and all mine
I'm gonna be rescued from the love

I wanna feel the heart of fire bad joy,
Don't you break up my foolin'
I'm gonna make a shake of our sex toy
Never let me get coolin'

I spin around a wheel, I spin around a green
Bad, bad, bad toy
And now I come again, again into my brain
Just a bed toy

On the fast lane screaming my name
I wanna spend my time
In the disco in the night club
I'll be the shining star

When I feel like rocking the nation
No one else can chain my fire
STOP! STOP! Don't try to convince me
'Cause I'm a crazy horse
Call me Tora

Every day every night - call me Tora
In the middle of fight - I'll have my fun
Baby, baby this is my name
Never forget it then you can call me Tora

Leave my boyfriend, kiss your boyfriend
This is my loving style
On the cellphone, on the chatboard
I'm gonna weave my web

Hey! I never knew somebody like you
Who makes me feel so high
A sparkling fly when we're together
You got me from the start

We share something special
You are the one I just asked lord for
Your mine and so precious
I'll never let you go

We can't run away from our desire
We have passed the point of no return
It is much too late to stop the fire
Babe, there's no turning back

And the way you love me it's amazing
You rock me inside out
I'm into deep you drive me crazy
Oh! Babe you're so hot!

No, no i would never have got here
No, no i would have never said it
Oh, boy, don't you see that it's over?
Oh, boy, don't you feel what i'm feeling

Well, there's nothing else we can do
No way to go back to love
Hell! It makes me sad
But i can't help to say it plain and simple

Running on love, running on love which is
Breaking my heart laying all down
So i'll stop the pain, break the chain
Everything will be behind me

Love, love is a matter of fire
And now both we had it just cooled down
Don't don't, please don't even try to spell
Don't don't don't you see your denial?

Love's on our minds
And our time is going to find the way
I need to know if you can give me
More and more

You're my lovely light
I wanna stay with you for all the night
That's what I love
And our bodies keep movin' on

Your body is connected, it's alright
I like the way you make me feel tonight
And now my body's going on tonight
You and me, what a lovely way!

Lovers, just me and you
Two lovers, we never feelin' blue
Close forever, we're loving too
Two lovers, just me and you
Two lovers, you break my heart in two

Between the nations there's confusion
Each one has his own way to say
And understanding is a hardship
We need something to join them all

I think it
We'll call a meeting about it
There's a universal language
Which is known to all

Come on and try, sing na na na
It's easy, oh sing na na na

When east or west speaks to another
It's east they don't know what to say
To get the message to each other
Can take many nights, many days

How many times on that holiday
You told me "Let me love you again"
How many times face to face we said
Keep the promise that we made

Do you know (I) can forget the love
All the love you gave me (in) that
summer time
And tonight (I) want to hold you back
'Cause I know this is not wasted time

When you call me
When you see me
I feel like a princess in her castle
Can you feel me?
When I think of you
Show me the way to keep your love alive
(Do) you know that I love you?

It seems so far (the) time of sunny days
When you looked me in the eyes
I asked lord in these lonely days
Let me meet that guy once again

And looking back my love

Try, to be more relaxed
To have a happy life

Heart that's beating so hard
That's beating so lonely in this garden
Having faith, praying the lord that you will be
Around the world

The moonlight

Shadows of the night
The twilight over me and in my heart
Reminds me all the games you played with me
Reminds me all the promises that we made

The moonlight...

Looking at the moon you know you can find my soul
And I can find your lovin'
Looking at the stars tonight means to understand
Loud is the beatin' of my...

Night is romantic

And wonder about you
It's so fascnating
Side by side my lover
Once again... It's so crazy for me!!

Far away from my life

And rock you forever
It's a revolution
What is gonna happen
In my heart... time is comin tonite

Baby I don't care, you don't understand
If you only want a sweet romance
Walking by myself, looking for your eyes
Is no glory, no paradise

All I want is to say I love you
And I run after time
What can I do to feel good, now and ever?
You'll be the one, my love

Never let you say goodbye, pretending
Take my love, all my time 'cause I want you
Darlin' I don't care sometime, can't you hear me
Stay tonight, tell me why, oh I need you

Baby I don't know if your love is true
All I want is just to be with you
Playin' with my heart, fooling me around
Is no love and not even sound

This is hot for my heart
And enough for my brain
In the night all alone I'm waiting for you call
Time is flowing tonight
And I'm missing your voice
It doesn't matter if you won't be here

You are my love
You are my life
You are my angel and my paradise
Come to me now
Without a sound
...Yes I'm sleeping
Welcome my love!

Dream, an occasional dream
I can't get you for real
Just your face in my minds at morning
Dream, an oocasional dream
I would live in that dream
And believe that you want to drag me away

Naked eyes in the dark
Watching right to the wall
Just a whisper of loving is coming in my room
In the bed I'm alone
But I'm feeling so light
'Cause I know you are coming soon here

Look around baby tell me what the
hell is going on?
Baby tell me
Up and down, I can smell it in the air
There's something wrong...and it
scares me

In our society please it really
brothers me
That no one cares except me,

Why is the world so dark, and how can
I make it bright
I have a QUESTION
Why is the world so dark, and how can
we make it right
This is my QUESTION

All around love is power that is energy
very strong
Get into to
Tell the town... And you'll find the
answer is in this very song
Let me prove it

Call me, don't wait so long
Call me tonight 'cause I'm feelin' lonely
Ring me and talk to me
Show me your love and your sweet romance

I've been waiting in vain
Hopin' and dramin' and thinking of you
And over
I cannot fool me, cheat me

Purify your love, open up your heart
You've got only dreams
No better than it seems
Purify your love, fill it with your soul
Shining bright and clear
And love will make it real

Don't say you're far to come
Hear me tonight 'cause I need you badly
Feel me and be my light
Show me your face and your loving way

C'mon baby let your body free
Get over your mind
And open your eyes, too
Honey, honey, feel the rhythm
You know, my love, I follow my emotions.

This time I wanna live a magical dream, oh really!
Listen to me

Satellite love, satellite lover
Spinning around......far in the sky

Turning in the blue... I wanna fly

Every step you take away from me
Is telling me now
That you wanna leave me
Baby, baby (I) wanna show you
Up to the sky, a dream to be discovered

Hello you! my darling, surprised that it's me?
But I can't stand all alone now so far away
Can't stand anymore!

...And it's now that I believe you

...And it's now or never to forgive
And it's time to make me yours

And disappear flying in a blue dream
Woh oh oh!

How are you my sweety, how long was that time
But I go back to my steps now, I'm really sorry
I came here to stay

Tell me now the words to call you
Let me take you let me hold you
There's a way... to reach a paradise

If only I could show you how it's easy
You'd erase the bad images worrying you
And you'll be happier

And you'll know that it's time to believe in you
'Cos the world is never the same oh baby
When you change your destination

Standing ovation for you when you smile
When you understand in your heart
There's a way... just to keep believing

Baby blue
You're stuck in my heart
There's nothing now that I can do

Once in a day
We’re just runnin’ away
If together we slide in a dream
We can see that there is nothing to hide
And the love that we’re givin’ each other
Could reach on the highest climb
Lovin’ together…

Once in the life
We’ll be glow in the light
As we’re tasting the moment to be
Burnin’ passion inside our hearts
And love that we’re livin’ together
Won’t be such a shame, and they’ll see
That it is matching, close in our dreams

You can tell me what you want
You can say that it is too strong
You can make it on your own
Now and forever

If the time is on my side
You’ll discover a love inside
You can live it on your own
Now and forever

Still on the run
We can stare at the sun
There’s no need to be close to the edge
Of an eden of anyone
And the breathe of the life that we can share
With the world maybe it is gone
Still in your heaven, still in your dreams

Let's get out tonight
I wanna feel alright
Get inside your car
Let your body move
We'll party to the groove
Dancin' like a star

Right, let's get together
Right, I'll be your lover
Now, i wanna make it through the night

Dancin' time 
And movin' like romancin'
I feel fine
A flash in the sky
Dancin' time
And nothing's gonna stop me now

Dancin' time
I'll play the game of glances
I feel fine
We're young shinin' bright
Dancin' time 
And lovin' cannot stop tonight

I feel like a child
No complicated mind
Shame is not my style
That's what I adore
Movin' dancin' more
Your body next to mine

Is comin' out in style
To shout at me she's ready
Rockin' the night

Move on, the time is tight
And follow the callin' of the wild

Come to the rockin' dome

Scream out the starlight from the sky
Come to the rockin' dome

Open up your eyes
And again and again and again

Come on sugar come on darling

Everybody need somebody
Need somewhere to hide

See the moon in the sky
See the passion and close your deep blue eyes
Fly to the high emotions
Like a butterfly, make me right

Lusted paradise and magic harmony
Come on with me
And take me to the sky
With your best imagination

Running in the dark
Out of the visions of my passion
Running in the dark
A lovely spark, the good direction
Running in the dark
Fly to the moon with wild sensations
Running in the dark
A lovely spark
My way and my direction, in the night
Running in the dark
And vision in my mind

All my beautiful dreams

Dreaming the secret land
The sweetest ecstasy for your mind

Monday morning is so sad
In to my life

Walking around the days of week

Tonight you'd better make up your mind

Everybody knows love comes just one time in a life
Everybody say love is life it must be right
When I saw you baby you first seemed a melody
I realize you were an angel survive for me

I believe to live in a dream
I was full for you
But I wake up with a scream
When you treat me like you do

Why did you break my heart
Why did you say I'm sorry
Please baby don't give up
Don't throw away this story

When I'm looking into your eyes
I wonder if you care
If you've ever been mine
If you have something to share

Love is like a danger, darlin'
Love is like a toy
When I expect my feelings
Will fill you up with joy

Can't you see I'm waiting for you
Please come back to me
When you treat me like you do
When your arms are hurting me

Make love you don't make war
It's easy to recite but it doesn't mean a damn
Unless I'm gonna fight with your heart made of stone
Baby look all around you

You've got to take a stand
Love makes the world go around but you don't hear the
sound
Open up your heart 'cause I'm ready to start
I can't keep on without you

Before it gets too late
We have to change our fate
I'll give you love if you want it
Please baby change your mind
Don't want a love of this kind
My love is here if you get it
Why baby you don't give me love

I am burning with desire
Got to believe it I'm burning in the fire
Yes I'm burning with desire
You got to tell me why-hy
You don't give me love

Make love you don't make war
It's easy to forget if you think love's a lie
Love means to understand reach out for someone's hand
Baby look all around you

Love makes the world go round
You have to play my way baby and make all my days
Open up your heart 'cause my love is a dart
I can't keep on without you

I lose the time of my life
Another day in my mind
You are moving like a sweet angel tonight
I lose control on my destiny, my soul
I keep on dreaming with love, my only
Love...

I've been cheated by you since I don't know when
So I made up my mind, it must come to an end
Look at me now, will I ever learn?
I don't know how but I suddenly lose control
There's a fire within my soul
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything, w-o-o-o-oh

Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again?
My my, just how much I've missed you
Yes, I've been brokenhearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, now I really know,
My my, I could never let you go.

I've been angry and sad about things that you do
I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through
And when you go, when you slam the door
I think you know that you won't be away too long
You know that I'm not that strong.
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything, w-o-o-o-oh

Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again?
My my, just how much I've missed you
Yes, I've been brokenhearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, even if I say
Bye bye, leave me now or never
mamma mia, it's a game we play
Bye bye doesn't mean forever

Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again?
My my, just how much I've missed you
Yes, I've been brokenhearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go
Mamma mia, now I really know
My my, I could never let you go

Where are those happy days, they seem so hard to find
I tried to reach for you, but you have closed your mind
Whatever happened to our love?
I wish I understood
It used to be so nice, it used to be so good

*So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me
S.O.S.
The love you gave me, nothing else can save me
S.O.S.
When you're gone
How can I even try to go on?
When you're gone
Though I try how can I carry on?

You seem so far away though you are standing near
You made me feel alive, but something died I fear
I really tried to make it out
I wish I understood
What happened to our love, it used to be so good

*Repeat

*Repeat

When you're gone
How can I even try to go on?
When you're gone
Though I try how I can carry on

Back in september, long ago
When you told me not to worry
And then you held me tight
Could be right or could be wrong
I was not feeling sorry
Love was the reason.

Come on, tell you're feeling' unhappy
Tell me now you are missing all that
'Cause when something inside is missing
Baby you shouldn't give in.

Always together with my baby
Promising love forever
You said you were made to love me honey
Gettin' on once again
With you.

Can you remember what you said
When we used to be together
Just like two little kids
Could be sun or could be rain
With no money as ever
Love was the reason

Come to my life
It's so easy to say
You're still in the time
To be mine forever

Feeling alive
Feeling young once again
I tell you baby what is good & right

Give up, give up, give up
Stay with me tonight, forever
Give up, give up, give up
Give up, give up, give up

Dance with me tonight
Dance with me together
Dance with me, all right?
Stay with me, forever

Come to my world
It's so easy to say
Don't waste your time
And be mine forever

Feeling alone
Feeling down once again
I tell you baby that's no good & right

You need some time to think
Once you put your life all back together
I don't wanna hurt you
So baby I'm gonna leave, gonna set you free

You'll get back on your feet
Once you put your life all back together
Look at me and listen
You're gonna see that I'm right how it's gotta be

I don't wanna lose you, don't wanna use you
Listen and you will be just fine
I don't wanna lose you, don't wanna confuse you
Go and get it back together

Get it back, get it back together
Get it back, if it takes whatever
Get it back, get your life together
Get it back, and make it much better

Tell it to you again
Gotta get your life all back together
You know that I love you
So baby get up and be all that you can be

I'm a woman, I'm a lady
Lots of men think I'm crazy
That's because, I keep my lovin'
And I don't plan to give up nothin'
Here's how it goes
When you're alone he wants to take off all your clothes

But you know, when I say no...
I really mean that I say no!

I think it's time to get up and go
This is just what it means
When a girl tells a man no
Get up and go!!! Just let him know
Understand what it means when a girl says no!!!

When I'm ready I'll be willing
For love that is so fulfilling
But for now I'll keep my lovin'
It's worth more than a one night humpin'

I see it in your eyes
And tell you baby that's desire
I feel it in my heart
You're giving up to your sweet love

Fooling 'round with lovers
Can't you feel it
'Round, 'round, 'round
You're fooling 'round with love
Playing 'round with others
Can't you see it
Down, down, down
I feel about you

In the heat of the night won't you call me
Won't you break up a dream again
In the heat of the night won't you tell me
Why you're playin' with me tonight

I see it in your smile
And tell you baby, you're on fire
I feel it in my heart
You've got enough,
you just want more

Never again I'll fall in love
And I swear that I'll try to leave you alone
Maybe someone someday somewhere
Maybe I will find the love of my life

Watchin' the sunset in the sky
I don't believe you can stop to love me
Watchin' the sea I find the words I love you so

And if you leave me now
Those lovely times with you
Are fading in the past
And nothing gonna change
I tell you please love me now
You left this empty room
But now I realize
So far away I feel so disparate

And all my love is whole and lives
And I think you'll hurt me just for spite
Let's try again I'm waitin' for
Waiting for the time when you'll coming back

Each and every morning
We wake up and love one another
Your love's never boring
You know how to love like no other

Every second we're together
I can't believe how much it's better
And I need you never leave you
This is something I wanna say:

Keep love coming you are my everything
Keep love coming I'll give you anything
Keep love coming you are the best you see
Keep love coming I'll give you all of me

Each and every morning
When we kiss and hug under covers
You play and you tease me
You're a secret wonder my lover

Love can be oh so beautiful
This is the fact it's wonderful
Doing the things you love to do
Making it last becuase it's true

Some people say it never lasts
Using jealousy so you'll break it fast
I don't care what they say, I don't care what they do
I'm gonna keep on loving you

Making it last as long as we can
We're gonna make it last...
Keep on... making the very best
Doing whatever's clever...

Keep on trying to make it last for long
Keep on trying 'cause we got a love so strong
Keep on having lots of fun each day and night
Keep on holding each other very tight...

People may tell you what to do
Thinking no one can undo
History no one can undo
Let no one else decide for you...

What a wonderful chance
What a wonderful day to live
Can you ask for more
Oh in every sense
What a wonderful day you see
Listen baby

You will never know
You will never feel it
You will never understand
Baby
You will never change
You will never feel it
You will never realize
That the

Season of love is now, follow your heart

You won't be afraid
You see the season comes again and again
So listen do it babe, the season is now

There is no more illusion
But only a big confusion
You crossed my life
Just like a flash in the night
What a surprise!

We felt a lovely passion
Together satisfaction
What can I do
If I can't stay without you

I don't want to see me die
I don't want to lose my mind
Whenever you call my name
I'll be there, I need you again

We can win if we can keep the faith in your heart you

Hear the scream of types on the mountain
And all the silence lying on the trees and deep inside you
Glory is a movement, is lightning the runs into your veins
Into your veins, remember your

Day of thunder days of spark
The crazy race with light off in the dark
The wind can blow us away but we'll always be friends
As we used to be in our days of thunder

Day of thunder days of spark
Life is a gamble to die for at the start
The pride can keep us apart but we'll always be friends
As we used to be in our days of thunder

Driving fast, alone in your car
Realizing your fear is gone too far
But you know you're not scared to lose
Cause you'll win if you can keep the faith in your heart you

Those faces from my past are now history
People gone forever

Photograph - pictures of me and you
Photograph - the moment that won't come back
Photograph - capture a shot of love

To hold you in my arms and laugh about your lies
'Cause you're gone forever

We are used to stay together
When the ngiht is cold
We are used to live in a room
Ordinary and old

The world around
It seems to disappear
Shelter of my soul
I didn't ask for something other
Than to rest in your heart

Only with your love I can feel it
Only with your love
Only with your love I can make it through
The best of my life

We can keep on with this living
Walking hand in hand
I'll be with you when you'll take me
To the promise land

Look in your eyes

Lookin' at you

Help me please baby show me the way
I don't ever want to leave you all alone
Can't you see I need you
More every day

Tell me that you're not like the others
Tell me that you won't love another
Tell me that everyday will be the same
KISS AND HOLD ME TIGHT

To be by your side
Gonna make me strong enough
Being your mad it's a work
Sometimes so tough

When you getting closer to me I can't resist
Baby I'm dying for you
In the night I call you when I dream of you
Can't you see I need you

Whisper words of fire oh oh

For my loving nights oh oh

For the things you will see tomorrow

Even if you say you never know
The way we'll be tomorrow
Even if you say say we got to wait
We got to face the sorrows

Even if you try to put some time
between us
Maybe I'll see
Always in your mind and your eyes
The light of what you really dream

In your world everyday maybe or
maybe not
All affinity's over
Somebody can make it up
So that baby suddenly
We'll have it back one day

'Cos love is forever...

That night, we met him together
You said he was good for me
I knew deep inside I was in love
A love that would last forever

I believe that you and I were best friends
That we'd stay this way till the end
I had a shock when I saw you talking and kiss
Each other into my bedroom

Slap in the face when I opened the door
I got a slap in the face, but I ain't gonna take it
Slap in the face my heart spilled on the floor
I got a slap in the face I should have known better, known better

That night, you betrayed a friend and
That night you destroyed my love
I wish never fall in love again
And I won't be fool no never

Boy I tried to tell you that love is precious
Love is not to fool around with
Boy I tried to warn you that if you ditched her
One day you were gonna miss her

Don't just sit there, it's time for a change
Now you gotta try a little, got to be stronger
Don't just sit there, you're goin' insane
Be a fighter, you got to go find her

How's it gonna be boy?
Now that your love has left you and gone with another
What's it gonna be boy?
Now that you lost the only girl you've ever loved

You are on your own now... GET UP OFF 'A YO' BUM!!!

I can see you're lonely, your heart is broken
Words of love you leave unspoken
This is so unlike you, never say never
Brother get yourself together

Don't just sit there on top of your pride
Now you gotta think a little, got to be wiser
Don't just sit there, you're losin' your mind
Be a fighter, you got to go find her

How's it gonna be boy?
Now that you sleep alone and you dream of no other
What's it gonna be boy?
Now that you finally realize she's the only one

You are on your own now... GET UP OFF 'A YO' BUM!!!

This is some party, I'm feelin' kinda wild
It's time I let go and just let my soul unwind
This is my party, I'm gettin' in the groove
I want some-adventure and that's when I saw you

Isn't it a shame, that I still don't know your name
But boy, there's passion in the air, that's real clear
Why don't you come over here?

I got somethin' you will cry for, I got somethin' real (baby)
I got somethin' all men die for, I got somethin' you'll feel

For love and desire, and anything taboo
This is my nite boy, cuz you look like a god
I'd sure like your blessing, just reach out and touch me

Isn't it a crime, that you've finished all your wine
But boy, why don't you take a sip of my love
Baby my love is divine

I got somethin' sweet and pleasin', I got somethin' you'll want

Everytime I close my eyes I see u smilin'
You're my light, my meditation
Everytime I see u boy my soul start's flying'
You're my wind, my inspiration

You are just sitting
Looking through windows
And you are wondering
What to do girl
Back in the hunted
Flying at shadows
Waiting for something
Bad to be worried

Why don't you dance again
You'll be forgetting how to dance
Whoa whoa
Come on baby
You could never stay there forever
Like a friend of sorrow
Come on baby
Just stop being workin' on turbo
If you open the window
There will be waiting something

You don't know reasons
Why you're the winner
And why the holder
Didn't stay together
Nobody could tell them
What's wrong in them
The past is behind
Like the running water

Why don't you dance again
You'll be forgetting how to dance
Whoa whoa
Come on baby
You could never stay there forever
Like a friend of sorrow
Come on baby
Just stop being workin' on turbo
If you open the window
Come on baby
You could never stay there forever
Like a friend of sorrow
Come on baby
Just stop being workin' on turbo

When I'm feelin' blue
I turn in my mind to you
On your way to make me smile
To let in my heart a light

Ain't no secret,
You make me do some fool things
And others crazy
When you're near my head goes dizzy
Make me feel I'll fly

Eyes of sky - in your soul is wrought my universe
Eyes of sky - I'm a kite flyin' in the wind of love
Soarin' high, reachin' for the shinin' light
I just wanna find a place inside your heart
No, I never wanna stay apart - eyes of sky

Think of you tonight
Your message is on the line
I'll paint all the world and write
"I wanna stay by your side"

When I'm lookin a magic mirror
I see the light of your love in my eyes
You can find in my heart the power
Show your face to my face right now

Come to my desire, come in to my fire
I know you can feel me
if you go you can kill me
Looking to your body I need you to love
We can take a chance for tonite

FACE TO FACE give me your affection
Don't you play the game of your expression
FACE TO FACE taking your direction
I can say is better that solution

Look that man and tell me your reason
Give it up and just look at me
See the light of my love inside me
Feel the heartbeat for you my girl

Livin' and dying, it doesn't matter where is
I love it, I love it, I love this country
Breaking the system, it doesn't matter how much
I swear it, I swear it, that I'll be happy

I feel the pressure that's in my blood
And I feel the fire that is burnin' me,
I feel without pain, 'cause I'm so fine,
And I realize what is the reason for that

LIVIN' IN AMERICA - It's just amazing,
And I hope it could be always like my wishes
LIVIN' IN AMERICA - It drives me crazy
But I hope you will be livin' with me my babe!

Laughin' and cryin', it doesn't matter why,
I need it, I need it, I need this country
Shocking the system,
And this is my all dreaming is livin',
Is livin' in U.S.A. now

Can't sleep, so sweet is the night

Every morning
I wake up with a sound
When I open both my eyes I realize
It's not my town, my place
I'm like a stranger

Now I gotta prepare
I start to beware.....
Tonight there's another show and
I get ready to play
Get ready to sing
I'm gonna make people dancing

I'M ON THE ROAD, won't let you down
Come to the show..... gonna play in your town
I'M ON THE ROAD, I'll play for you
So many times I performed that song too

I remember wake up with a sound
Meeting the people outside waiting for
I was there just for them
A great emotion

I listen to words that I can hardly conceive
Hate and confusion together
They show me the way but I just don't believe
Nobody's changing today

Waiting for some love to come
I really wanna know the heart of the people around

I REMEMBER THE TIME when I was like a child
And the people who smiled at me
Were burning inside of a joy still alive
In the mem' rise of my sweetest dreams

I follow the lite but ain't no way to go
No way to go thru for ever
So why don't you understand I'm not willing to fall
I feel I'm drifting away

Waiting for some love alive
I really wanna know if you need to hold me tonite

I REMEMBER THE TIME when I was like a child
And the people who smiled at me
Were burning inside of a joy still alive
In the mem' rise of my sweetest dreams

I REMEMBER THE TIME when the sun in the sky
Used to give us a lite and more
I'm sure about that I can only regret
A line in the deep of my heart:

REMEMBER THE TIME

Hey hey everybody
C'mon babe to the party time
Hey hey funky babe
Come together to the Tokyo night

Love is like a fantasy
Leave your problems come with me

Hey hey everybody
You're the king
And i'm your dancing queen

Like a gambler for a crazy win...

How many times I'll go so lonely
Many nights without your love
Tears are falling down so wetting all the floor

Many colors on the rainbow
And shadows in my life
When I'm looking for your eyes I feel to die

Many troubles in my story
And shadows in my life
When I'm calling for your name, I feel to die

I'm singing again for love
I'm singing for you
Little devil when I'm singing in the rain

I'm singing again for tomorrow
I'm crying for you
When I'm touching all the colors of the pain

Hunting for somebody's love
(I've) Gotta something from above
Baby, can't you see
Give your love to me... oh oh oh

So you fall into my day
Got it all withoug a way
Was I feeling shy?
But you made me rise

Oh oh
When the love has gone for me

You can't set me free
You can't set me free

I wanna get somebody to love him

I wanna get it all for me

I wanna get somebody to love him
I wanna get somebody who's loving me

Daydreaming to stop my mind
Looking after wasted time
You're a part of me
Honey, can't you see? Oh oh oh

No more days without your love
No more rainy skies above
No more lonely nights
No more silly lies

Get a rave on the cave
Age of stone rap music
Tonite I'm gonna wear my best fur again
Shake the club on the dub
Prehistoric dee-jay
Tonite I'm gonna be just your girl again

Jump and move yabba-dabba-dabba-doo
Dynos sing forever
Jungle groove shabba-dabba-dabba-doo
We found the fire together
We go

Walking on the dyno
Walking on the dyno
Walking on the dynosaur of love
Walking on the dyno
Walking on the dyno
Walking on the dynosaur of love
Together we are rolling like a rolling stone
Wee at the dyno meat well cooked to the bone
Walking on the dyno
Walking on the dyno
Walk the dynosaur of love

Bang a gong monkey-kong
Cump your sweet banana
Somebody's stoning the dusty floor again
Comes a bark from the dark
Of the wild savannah
Tonite we're gonna lock up the door again

I see my days and my life passin' by
Together we can hold the line
We need to find a new direction
Baby you take me away

You are the winner in my destiny
You're the freedom I'm looking for

Like a night full of dreams
I'll take you

Welcome to the beach welcome to the night

Don't you know my secret feelings
Must be I'm dreaming

I dream of you, baby tonight
I want some more than tasting a bite
I dream of you, why
Feeling so hot and cold
So cold
I dream of you, baby tonight
I want to touch your face in the light
I need some more, why
Flying so high and low
So low

See me walking out in the street
People talk to me but I'm not there
Words are falling down to my feet
Baby now I just don't care

In the darkness of the night
Boon Boon Bang Bang
BIG DESIRE-weeh oh!!

In the fire of my heart
Going going down down
Hot Desire - weeh oh!!

Straight to the heart inside
Dancin' goes on tonight
Music sounds like a bad desire
Deep down into my soul
Something is growing up
BIG DESIRE

"BIG DESIRE" it's a feeling coming from the
heart on fire wo-oh, wo-oh, ooh.
It' s a "BIG DESIRE" something like a sexy night in
Bed of fire wo-oh, wo-oh, ooh. It' s a....

In the cities of the world
Boom Boom bang bang
BIG DESIRE weeh oh!

In the pocket if my boy
Going going down down
Hot desire - weeh - oh!

Do me do me, do me what you want
Tell me, tell me, tell me your desires
Dare to show me what you need
'Cause you cannot tell me no
You cannot spoil the night

Change your stillness into energy
Thing out what you can now get from me
Let me push the button of your soul
Turning your prohibitions in a wave, that will....

Come & go, come and go - crawling to the top - uh ooh - uh oh
Come & go, come and go - like a fire
Come & go, come and go - could it ever stop?
From my head to the toes I can feel the vibe

Touch me - touch me, touch me as you know
Fell it - fel it, fell it this heart on fire
I'm the kingdom, you are my king
'Cause tonight I can't say no
I can't back up and hide

Don't be a fool, don't run away
I got my ways to make you stay
Don't mess around with me
Cause I don't care
I know my life is just a game

Stop trying to find a way out
Give your body and soul to me now
I feel that it's all over you
And I know you feel it too

Down Down Down in my heart tonight
Down Down baby my heart desire
Down Down cause I know I
Down Down meet me my hell of fire

Now that you know, now that you try
You can get up and say goodbye
You messed around with me
Now you don't care
You know your life is just a game

All I want is to have some fun
In my life I wanna travel the world around... yes
Tokyo, Paris, New York
So trendy and fantastic for me and you

But there's a place I think about all of the time
The kind of place to get into your heart
And blow your mind
The sun is warm the people is so lovely
The moon is a friend and wants to sing with you

Take me, take me in the heart of Rome
Romance and domes
The night won't be long enough
Take me, take me in the heart of Rome
And nothing will be too much
Come on baby

Do you wanna go there with me?
Where the days are easy and where the nights are sweet... yes
Julius Cesaer and the pope
Will drive us all round in a golden cab

This is the place I think about all the time

A diamond life is just what I need
Pleasure and joy forever
Get what I can get 'cos life is a bet
No pleasure and pain together

But you know for sure
There is something I miss
I'll let you guess I know you will get it 
'Cos I would forget everything for a kiss
But if you've got some money I know
Would be better

Give me love and money 
Give me your love my baby
Give me kisses honey
I deserve the best you know it
Give me love and money
I have the rest already 
Love and money coming from you 
Is what I need

A shinning life is just what I want
You and me inside a cabin
Get what I can get but I lost my pet
You're poor but I need your loving

Don't be scared if your heartbeat goes away,
It will come back
Don't be shy when you sskin begins the match
Let it play

When it's love you touch the heaven and
When it's love you rush the wedding and
Then you'll know deep into the care for sure
No more running

It's only love oh babe love you will take you too
No more hiding your broken heart oh babe
Love will get you cool
No more running it's...

Don't be sad when the music seems to cry 
it will smile too
Don't be wild when the moon is shining up in the sky

Every girl is dreamer every girl is ready to
say "it's forever"
And it's hard keep on starting it over
When you can see that men are only kids
and liars

But you got to go on keep the faith
And you will find somebody you can trust
Don't close yourself to the secret of loving
Don't close yourself because you don't know

Oh my Juliet you will learn about your life
Oh my Juliet you will see the world inside
of you
He'll never deserved you he'll never find
one like you again

Oh my Juliet you will find another lover
Oh Juliet you're treasure to discover don't
do
All the mistakes I did
Don't throw away yourself don't throw
away your love don't you

Every girl is dreamer every girl is ready to
say together
And it's hard to hear him say that it's over
When you just want somebody to love
you forever

Wake up baby, my little baby
I wanna make love to you
Little boy while you're talking too much
I hope that you feel it too

Set you free and build up your confidence
So you can be on top of this world for once
Eyes wide shut to look at the evidence
Can't you see the fire in me

I just wanna be with you
Come on over to me
And tonight make my dream come true
I just wanna be with you
Let me be the one
Why be alone when you can be mine

Tell me baby, my little baby
Do you wanna make love with me
Little boy while you're talking to much
I'm gonna give you a kiss

You just fly around
Never touch the ground
Girls in your life they come and go
Think you're heaven bound
You go up and down
But deep inside you're all alone

I toss'd and turn'd for you
You broke my heart in two
You lovely butterfly
The more I close my eyes
The more I find
Tonight

Power of my love tonight
Power of my love for you
Can you feel my heart just reachin' for you now babe
Through the wild

Power of my love, inside
Power of my love, fly high
I can give you wings, then up in the sky now babe
Eagle-like

Now I realise
How you changed my life
Don't wanna sit down here and cry
Let the pain go by
Feel the joy inside
I know my heart won't let you go
