LyricScraper is a stand-alone python file which scrapes the eurobeat-prime.com
lyrics database and stores the lyrics to lyrics.txt. Also the SongData objects 
for each song gets pickled with the default python pickling library and stored
to pickled.bin. This is the only way to recover the artist and title
information.

Other files are documented in their docstrings.
